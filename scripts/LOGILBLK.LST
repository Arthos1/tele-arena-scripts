; LOGILBLK.LST - List of Node-IDs which are blocked from linking.
;
; If you wish to prevent a certain node or nodes from linking up with your BBS,
; you can list the Node-IDs in this file.  Each Node-ID you specify must be
; separated by white space or listed on a new line.
;
; Example:
;
; DMA
; LAP
; DEMO ; Don't want any demo linkups!
;
; Since anything to the right of the ; character is considered a comment, the
; Node-IDs shown in the example above will not really be blocked.  You can
; use comments anywhere you like in this file.  Comments are useful for noting
; reasons why a certain node is being blocked.
