               |   Welcome to The Major BBS by Galacticomm!   |
               |______________________________________________|


    If you've used The Major BBS before, you'll probably have no trouble
    finding your way around.  If you haven't, this document is intended to
    help you learn your way around.  A few basics to keep in mind:  if you
    want to exit from wherever you are in the system, select X; all
    selections and commands must be followed by a RETURN; on menus (and
    most prompts) you may select ? for help; and hit the RETURN key to
    abort lengthy scrolling displays.

    This document will serve two purposes:  1) to help you get started
    (using The Major BBS for this first time), and 2) to be a reference for
    you, even after you've found your way around (to answer the question,
    "I wonder... is there a way to do <blank> in the <blank> module?").


    A Quick Overview
    ----------------

    When you first call into The Major BBS, you're asked to "sign up",
    creating an account for yourself.  If you're online reading this
    document, you must have already signed up, and should now have a
    User-ID and password that you can use from now on.  Now, when you call
    in, all you have to do is enter in your User-ID and then your password.
    The BBS will remember who you are, and start by telling you if you have
    any mail waiting (it may also ask you if you want to read it right
    away).  You might also get some other important notices, but will
    eventually be left at the TOP menu.

    The TOP menu is the first menu on the BBS.  The various selections on
    this menu go to different areas of the BBS.  Here's an example of what
    the TOP menu might look like:

     Please select one of the following:

         T ... Teleconference            (talk with other online users)
         I ... Information Center        (get some info on this system)
         F ... Forums                    (read/write public messages)
         E ... Electronic Mail           (read/write private messages)
         L ... Library of Files          (upload/download files)
         A ... Account Display/Edit      (edit/view your account info)
         P ... Polls and Questionnaires  (answer polls and questionnaires)
         R ... Registry of Users         (look up users' registry entries)
         X ... Exit System (Logoff)      (Logoff the system)

     (TOP)
     Make your selection (T,I,F,E,L,A,P,R,? for help, or X to exit):

    By typing in one of the select characters, followed by a RETURN, you
    can enter any of these different areas.  As an example, this is how you
    might go about leaving a private E-mail message to your Sysop (System
    Operator -- the person who runs this system).  First, select E to go
    into Electronic Mail, which will bring you to this menu:

     The following E-mail services are available:

        R => Read message(s)       (read any mail TO or FROM you)
        W => Write a message       (write mail to any other user)
        M => Modify a message      (modify a message you've written)
        E => Erase a message       (erase a message you've written)
        S => Special functions     (configure your personal mailbox)
        X => Exit from E-mail      (exit back to the TOP menu)

     Select a letter from the above list, or ? for more info:

    Now, in this example, you would select W to write mail.  That selection
    would bring you to this prompt:

     Who do you wish to send this message to?
     Enter User-ID, "?" for help, or just RETURN for "Sysop":

    In this example, you'd only have to hit a RETURN (with no selection) to
    specify "Sysop".  If you wanted to write mail to someone else, you
    would simply type in their User-ID here (if you don't know the whole
    User-ID, but only know the first or last name, you can just enter what
    you know, and the BBS will help you find the exact User-ID).

    Now, you'll be asked for the topic of your message.  After entering in
    a topic, you'll be put into the editor.  Depending on whether or not
    the terminal you're using to call in with has ANSI support, you may get
    the Full Screen Editor.  This ANSI editor will act very much like a
    small word processor, allowing you to use your cursor keys to move
    around the message.  You can feel free to just type your message as you
    wish it to appear to your Sysop.  The automatic word-wrap will wrap
    words at the end of lines appropriately.  Just hit CTRL-G whenever you
    are done, and want to save your message.  Hit CTRL-O if you changed
    your mind and want to quit.  All sorts of advanced commands are also
    available.  Just hold down the control key and hit R (CTRL-R) to
    display some other commands:

     ษอ HELP (CTRL-W for more) ออัออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออป
     บ CTRL-Z Select Terminal    ณ  CTRL-L Redisplay Screen     บ

    If you don't have ANSI support, you'll get the line editor.  The line
    editor doesn't allow you to move around with your cursor keys like the
    Full Screen Editor, so you have to enter your message one line at a
    time.  (The automatic word-wrap feature will wrap the end of lines for
    you, just like the ANSI editor.)  When you're all done entering your
    message with the line editor, and you want to go ahead and save it,
    just enter /S on a blank line by itself.  If you want to change
    something about what you've written so far, you can edit the message by
    typing OK on a blank line by itself.  That will give you this menu:

     EDITOR OPTIONS:

       S)ave message     R)e-type a line
       A)ppend message   D)elete line
       L)ist message     I)nsert line(s)
       C)hange text      N)ew message
       H)elp             T)opic change

     Select an editor option (S,A,L,C,H,R,D,I,N, or ? for menu):

    When you're done editing your message, just select S from this menu to
    save your message.  Then, you'll get this prompt (you come to this same
    prompt by typing /S in your message instead of typing OK and editing):

     Do you wish to "attach" a file to this message (Y/N)?

    If you answer Y to this question, your topic will be used as the file
    name (you'll get a chance to re-enter your topic if it's not a valid
    one), and you'll be asked to upload a file to the BBS.  When the Sysop
    reads your mail, he'll be asked if he wants to download the attached
    file.  Answer N if you don't need to send a file along with the
    message.  After all that, you'll get:

     Do you want a "return receipt" when this message is read (Y/N)?

    In other words, when the Sysop reads your message, do you want an
    E-mail message to be sent to you immediately, letting you know when the
    Sysop read it?  Just enter Y or N (followed by a RETURN, as usual) as a
    response.  You'll then get this prompt:

     Do you want to send a copy of this message to anyone (Y/N)?

    You can send copies of your message to other User-IDs if you wish.  If
    you answer Y to this question, you'll simply be prompted for which
    User-ID you want to send a copy to, and then asked if you want to send
    any more copies.

    That's all there is to writing E-mail to the Sysop.  The only
    difference between writing mail to the Sysop, and writing mail to any
    other User-ID is the name you type in when you're prompted for who you
    want to write the message to.  When you're done, you'll find yourself
    back at the main Electronic Mail menu, where you can hit X to get back
    to the TOP menu.  (Remember, when you decide you're ready to log off,
    just select X from the TOP menu.)

    This is only the tip of the iceberg as far as features are concerned.
    The rest of this document contains more in-depth information about the
    vast number of other features that this BBS has to offer.  If you have
    any problems finding your way around, just leave some E-mail to the
    Sysop asking for help.  When the Sysop replies to your message, you'll
    be notified as soon as you log on that you have new mail waiting.  If
    you're not given the option to read it right away, just select "ERT."
    from the TOP menu to read your new mail.


    Modules and Menuing
    -------------------

    The Major BBS is divided into two major sections:  the main menuing
    system and the modules.  Just after logging on, you enter the main
    menuing system, where you can choose to enter different areas of the
    BBS, exit from them, and choose others.  It's the main menuing system's
    job to guide you to and from the many features available to you.  The
    different modules in this system are what provide you with the main
    functionality of the BBS:  exchanging messages, talking to others,
    uploading and downloading, etc.  (The different modules are each
    discussed later in this document.)


    The Main Menuing System
    -----------------------

    The main menuing system of The Major BBS will allow you to choose
    different menu options, leading you into different areas, or modules,
    of the BBS.  Each main menu you encounter will display the options that
    you have available to you, and then await your selection.  To enter in
    any selection or command on The Major BBS, you must type it in, and
    then hit RETURN.  Each menu and menu selection is also called a "page",
    and has a name of its own.  (The first menu you are given is named the
    "TOP" page.)

    There are a few things you can do at any of these menus:  go back to
    the previous page, jump straight to another other page, find another
    page to jump to, or re-display the current menu.  Select X at any of
    these menus to return to the previous menu (selecting X from the TOP
    menu will allow you to log off the system).  Just hit RETURN (with no
    select character) to re-display your current list of options.  To jump
    straight to another page, type /GO <pagename>.  To look for a page
    containing a specific topic of interest, type FIND, followed by the
    topic to look for.  Any pages that you can /GO to that refer to that
    topic will be displayed.


    Global Commands
    ---------------

    Global commands are commands that begin with a / character, and are
    available to you from any prompt on the BBS.  Here are a few standard
    global commands:

     /GO <pagename>      Jump straight to a specific page name
     /#                  Show a list of other users online
     /P <userid> <msg>   Page another user on the system (with an optional
                         message)


    Concatenated Commands
    ---------------------

    You can probably find most things you're looking for by just going
    through menus one at a time.  But, concatenated commands allow you to
    save time by bypassing menus you already know your selection for.  The
    idea is this:  If selecting E from your current menu leads you to the
    main Electronic Mail menu, and you know you want to write mail, which
    is the W selection from the main electronic mail menu, you can just
    select EW from your current menu to entirely bypass the main Electronic
    Mail menu.  You can even bypass some prompts by concatenating your
    selection ahead of time.  Some prompts have "defaults", meaning you
    just hit a RETURN for a certain action.  At the prompt for who to write
    mail to, just hitting RETURN means you want to write mail to "Sysop".
    In the above example, you could specify you wanted to write mail to
    your Sysop by selecting EW. from your current menu.  Basically, by
    putting a dot (.) in your concatenated command (as opposed to a select
    character), you are saying "at this prompt, act as if I just hit
    RETURN, and give me the default".

    As you become more familiar with this system, you will find that using
    concatenated commands may save you quite a bit of time.  Most prompts
    and menus support concatenated commands, so you can feel free to
    experiment with using concatenated commands throughout the system...


    File Transfers
    --------------

    In different areas of the BBS, you will have the opportunity to
    transfer files from your computer to the BBS, as well as from the BBS
    to your computer (referred to as uploading and downloading files,
    respectively).  File transfers can be accomplished through a wide
    variety of "protocols", each of which have different characteristics,
    but all of which will have the same end-result:  transferring a file
    (or files) between your machine and the BBS.  This section simply
    introduces you to the options available to you through The Major BBS.

    To get you started, here's a quick rundown on the most popular
    protocols and their highlights:

     L = List          display a text file one screen at a time
     C = XMODEM-CRC    has very widespread usage, simple and to the point
     B = YMODEM Batch  widespread usage and full featured, gets the
                       file size right, and sometimes date and time too
     Z = ZMODEM        robust and efficient
     K = Kermit        works on 7-bit communication lines

    Download Protocols:

     L ... Listing (a screen at a time)    G ... YMODEM-g
     A ... ASCII (continuous dump)         Z ... ZMODEM
     M ... XMODEM-Checksum                 ZR... ZMODEM (resume after abort)
     C ... XMODEM-CRC                      K ... Kermit
     1 ... XMODEM-1K                       V ... View compressed file contents
     B ... YMODEM Batch
     T ... Tag file(s) for later download

     (Add '!' to automatically log off when done)


    Upload Protocols:

     A ... ASCII                           B ... YMODEM Batch
     M ... XMODEM-Checksum                 G ... YMODEM-g
     C ... XMODEM-CRC                      Z ... ZMODEM
     1 ... XMODEM-1K                       K ... Kermit

     (Add '!' to automatically log off when done)

    The terminal software you're using to call the BBS may not support all
    of these protocols.  Be sure to pick one that your terminal supports.
    (In most terminal programs, hit PgUp to get a list of upload protocols,
    and PgDn to get a list of download protocols.)  The ASCII and LIST
    protocols will only work with ordinary ASCII text files.  The other
    protocols will work on all types of files.

    Another protocol option will appear automatically when you're about to
    download a compressed file (or files).  Examples of these are .ZIP or
    .ARC files:  files that each contain one or more other files (in a
    compressed form).  The option V will appear in these cases, allowing
    you to view what file(s) are compressed into the .ZIP, .ARC, .ZOO, or
    .LZH file.

    Another download option that may be available is T to tag a file.  This
    feature allows you to tag up to 10 files for download, and then, when
    you're ready (or when you log off), you can download all your tagged
    files at once.

    Another time-saver is the ! suffix.  You can put an ! character at the
    end of your protocol selection to have the BBS automatically log you
    off when the file transfer is over.  This way, if you're not around to
    disconnect yourself when done transferring a large file, the BBS will
    disconnect you automatically, possibly saving you connect time charges.


    Modules
    -------

    Modules provide the actual areas of functionality of the BBS.  Each
    module provides unique features to you, and can be selected from the
    various menus in the main menuing system.  Below is a list of modules,
    each with an explanation of its features.  (This document may change
    from time to time as new modules are added to this system.)  The
    modules currently available to you are:

Swords of Chaos
-------------------

  Chaos is a multi-player adventure game. The goal (aside from socializing
  and having fun) is to hack and slash your way to power. You do this by
  exploring the realm, amassing treasure and killing monsters.

  Swords of Chaos is a Muinet product, written by Mark Peterson.

  E-Mail: jshannon@unix.adeptcom.com

Entering Commands
-----------------

  Whenever the game is waiting for you to do something, you will see a "Do?"
  prompt. At the Do? prompt you enter commands and parameters that tell the
  game what you want to do. All commands can be abbreviated to the point
  of "uniqueness" (i.e. you only have to type enough letters of a command
  to differentiate it from all the other commands). While playing the game
  you can get a list of all the different commands by typing 'help commands'.
  To get help for an individual command type 'help <command>'.

  Note: "." (a single period) will repeat your last command line and <ESCAPE>
        will cancel whatever you've typed on a line.

Communicating
-------------

  As a multi-player game, Chaos allows you to interact with other people
  also playing the game. No one likes reading help files, so it's often more
  convenient to ask questions of the experienced players. These are the
  commands for communicating with others:

  Where - Displays a list of everyone currently signed on to Chaos.
  Send  - Sends a line of text to everyone signed on to Chaos, i.e.
          Do? send hi everyone!
  Say   - Sends a line of text to everyone in your current location/room, i.e.
          Joe just arrived!
          Do? say hi Joe!
  Yell  - Sends a line of text to everyone in your current location/room and
          to everyone in the rooms that adjoin your current location, i.e.
          Joe just left!
          Do? yell hey joe, come back!
  Who   - Displays a list of all Chaos players (whether they are currently
          signed on or not).
  Gpost - Posts a message to the guild "forum". The forum is a place where
          people can post public messages (among other things).
  Gcheck- Read the messages in the guild forum.
  Post  - Post private mail to another player, i.e. Do? post joe
  Check - Read your private mail (if anyone has left you any).

  When you sign on to Chaos you occupy a "port". Port numbers start at 1,
  so the first person to sign on will occupy port 1, the next person will
  occupy port 2, and so on. Many of the communication commands relate to
  a person's port number. For example, to send a private message to the
  person on port 2 you would enter "send 2 hi there". Port numbers are
  displayed in the "where" display. 

Your Character
--------------

  Your character consists of a bunch of statistics and information that 
  determine what you can and cannot do and how well you can do it. The 
  command to display your character is "stats". Your stats consist of several 
  things:

  Name and Title
  --------------
  Your character is identified by it's unique name. Your character also
  has a "title", so generally a player is referred as "Name the Title"
  (the "the" is always inserted). To change your name and/or title, use
  the "rename" command.

  Class
  -----
  You must select a character class for yourself. The options are warrior,
  sorcerer, barbarian, thief, duelist, cleric, and mystic. Your class
  represents your characters background and inclination. Classes do not
  place restrictions on what you can and cannot do. For example, all players
  may attempt to rob players and monsters, but thieves are just better at
  it than non-thieves. Similarly, all players may learn and cast spells,
  but sorcerers, clerics and mystics are just better at it than the other
  classes. In addition to different special abilities and bonuses, the
  class you choose also determines which of your starting stats are
  increased when your character is first created.

  For a full explaination of the different starting bonuses and special
  abilities for the various classes, read the "character classes" help
  section.

  Physical Attributes 
  -------------------
  These are strength, dexterity, constitution, psychic ability, and
  intelligence. Your attributes affect many different situations in the
  game (see below), for a more detailed explaination see 'help stats'.
  
  Carrying Capacity
  -----------------
  Your strength determines your carrying capacity. The higher your strength, 
  the more items (by weight) and gold you can carry. 
  
  Combat Bonus
  ------------
  Your str, dex and int determine your base combat bonus. Your combat bonus
  is added to your rolls in combat. The higher your combat bonus, the more
  often you will score a "hit" and the more damage you will do when you do
  hit. For each 10 points of str, dex and int you receive a +1 to your
  combat bonus. I.E. if your str was 10, your dex was 20 and your int was
  15 your base combat bonus would be +4.

  Body Points
  -----------
  Your combined str and con determine your body points. So, whenever you
  increase your str or con, your body points also increase. Body points 
  indicate how many hits you can withstand in combat. Each time a monster 
  hits you you temporarily lose body points. If your body points ever go 
  below 0 you are killed (more on dying later). 

  Fatigue Points
  --------------
  Your combined str and con determine your fatigue points. Fatigue points
  represent your "stamina". Virtually every physical action in the game
  (i.e. fighting, moving, etc) has an associated fatigue point cost. As
  you perform actions, fatigue points are temporarily subtracted from your
  fatigue point total. If you try to perform an action and you don't have
  enough fatigue points left, then you will have to rest up (wait for your
  fatigue points to regenerate) before you can finally perform the action.

  Some activities use up more fatigue than others. For example, just moving
  between rooms uses less fatigue than combat. Being attacked also costs 
  fatigue. For example, if a monster swings at you but does no damage, you 
  still lose fatigue points. Similarly, if a monster attempts to "bash" you 
  (knock you down) and fails, you still get tired in the process. Face it, 
  evading blows can be as tiring as inflicting them.

  You naturally regenerate 1 fatigue point every 2 seconds. Also, you can
  naturally regenerate body points (again 1 point every 2 seconds). However, 
  you cannot regenerate body points until all your fatigue points have 
  been regenerated (i.e. you won't start to heal until you've had a chance to 
  rest). There are magic spells that let you regenerate fatigue and body 
  points much faster (more on spells later).

  Magic Points
  ------------
  Your psychic ability determines how many magic points you have. When
  casting spells, each individual spell has a different magic point cost.
  The number of points is temporarily subtracted from your magic point total
  whenever you cast a spell. If you do not have enough magic points left to
  cast the desired spell, then you must wait for your magic points to
  regenerate until you do have enough points. You regenerate 1 magic point
  per second (there are no spells that increase that regeneration rate).

  The command to list your current body, fatigue and magic point levels is
  "health".

  Approximate Level
  -----------------
  Players, unlike monsters, do not have generic "levels". However, your
  approximate level is a general measure of your power if you were a monster
  instead of a player. I.E. what level would a monster have to be to have
  stats like yours. Approximate level is used in very few calculations and
  is generally only useful for bragging rights.

  Weapon Class Bonuses
  --------------------
  All weapons in the game fall in one of the four weapon classes: edged
  (swords, axes, etc), blunt (maces, clubs, etc), pole (spears, etc), and
  "unarmed" (gauntlets, etc). Your character has a skill level for each of
  the different weapon classes. When you use a weapon of a given type,
  your bonus for that particular weapon class is added to your combat
  bonus. If you're not wielding any weapons at all, then your "unarmed"
  bonus is added to your combat bonus. Unarmed combat is just that,
  fighting without weapons. There are, however, unarmed combat "aids"
  that enhance your unarmed fighting abilities.

  Armor Class
  -----------
  Your armor class is a measure of how hard you are to hit. The higher the
  number, the more difficult you are to hit. So, when you put on armor or
  hold up a shield, your armor class will increase. The better the armor
  or shield, the higher your armor class will go.

  Defensive Ability
  -----------------
  Your defensive ability is your natural "armor class", representing your
  ability to avoid being hit. It is added on to your armor class as
  determined by any armor and/or shield you are currently using.

  Shield Skill
  ------------
  Your shield skill represents how affectively you can fight while holding a
  shield. It is added to your armor class (in addition to the armor class
  of any armor you might be wearing and the armor class of the shield 
  itself). Initially your shield skill is negative, so until you get better 
  at it, holding a shield can be something of a liability. While your shield
  skill is negative it is subtracted from both your armor class AND your
  combat bonus (however, once it becomes non-negative it is not then added
  to your combat bonus).

  Two Weapon Skill
  ----------------
  Your two weapon skill represents how affectively you can fight while
  wielding two weapons. If you are wielding two weapons, your two weapon
  skill is added to your combat bonus. Like the shield skill, your two-handed
  skill is initially a negative number, so until you increase it you will 
  find that you are a tad clumsy when wielding two weapons.

  Thief Ability
  -------------
  Your thief ability represents how adept your are at thieving. The higher
  the number, the greater your chance of successfully stealing from a
  monster or another player. The command to rob another player or a monster
  is "rob".

  Bank Balance
  ------------
  Your bank balance is how much gold you have deposited into your bank
  account. You get gold by killing monsters and taking their gold, or
  by taking their treasure and selling it. Gold is used to buy things
  or to pay for training (more on all that later).

  Inventory
  ---------
  Your character can carry up to 20 different items. To display the items 
  you are carrying, type "inventory". More on items later.

Rooms
-----
  
  Wherever your character is currently located in the game is it's current
  "room". For example, all characters start the game in "Town Square". A
  room consists of a a variety of different pieces of information. To look
  at the room you are in, the command is "look".

  Room Description
  ----------------
  Up to four lines of text which, in general terms, describe what you see
  and where you are.

  Exits
  -----
  These are the ways you can leave your current room and go to a different
  room. Exits consist of the directions north, south, east, west, up, down
  and out. To leave your current room via one of the exits, just type the
  direction you want to go (movement commands can all be abbreviated to 
  one letter, i.e. 'n', 'e', 's', 'w', 'u', 'd' and 'o'). Some rooms have
  hidden exits. To see if your room has a hidden exit use the 'search'
  command.

  Cover
  -----
  All rooms have a cover factor. The cover factor for a room determines
  whether or not you are successful when trying to "hide" in a room (more
  on hiding later). There are four levels of cover; no cover, sparse
  cover, moderate cover and heavy cover. The heavier cover, the easier it
  will be to find a hiding place.

  Special Exit
  ------------
  Some rooms have a "special" exit, i.e. one that does not correspond to a
  specific direction. For example "You see the palace" means that this room
  has a special exit which leads to the palace. To go to a special exit the 
  command is "go", i.e. "go palace". Some special exits are doors or gates
  which may or may not be locked. To open a locked door you can either use
  a key on it or attempt to smash it open with brute force (using the "smash"
  command). Some special exits are magical in nature and can only be opened
  with magic keys (normal keys and smashing will not work).

  Traps
  -----
  Some rooms have permanant traps in them. There are a variety of traps,
  all self-explainatory when you trip them. The protection spell will protect
  you from the affects of traps.

  Items
  -----
  If there are items laying on the ground in a room they will be displayed.
  To just look at the items in the room (and nothing else), type "items".

  Monsters
  --------
  If there are monsters in the room with you they will displayed. To just
  look at the monsters in the room type "monsters". If a room has
  "encounters" (i.e. monsters show up there), you will always encounter
  the same few monsters there. So, if there are certain monsters that you
  find profitable to kill, remember where you encountered them. Encounter 
  rates vary from room to room. Monsters will show up more frequently in some 
  rooms than others, and in some rooms monsters just don't show up at all.

  For the most part, monsters and items in a room are temporary. I.E. once
  the last player leaves the room, any monsters and items left behind will
  simply vanish. There are, however, several exceptions to this rule. Some
  monsters are "permanant", i.e. they will remain in a room until they have
  been killed. These monsters tend to be extremely deadly and should be
  avoided by all but the most powerful (or foolhardy) characters. There are
  also special rooms where items can be stored, more on these in a bit.

  Players
  -------
  If there are any other players in the room with you they will be displayed.
  The "monsters" command also displays other players if any are around.

  Safe Haven
  ----------
  Some rooms are designated "safe haven". This means that monsters cannot
  go there. Also, players are not permitted to fight each other there. There
  are a number of safe havens throughout the game (Town Square, for example,
  is a safe haven).

  Town Square
  -----------
  Town Square is a common meeting place for players, it also is the room
  where you start the game. Items left on the ground in town square will
  stay there forever, or until someone finally comes along and picks them
  up. Town Square is considered public property, so generally speaking
  any items left unclaimed there should be considered "up for grabs".

  The Bank
  --------
  In the bank you can "withdraw", "transfer" or "deposit" gold. To get to 
  the bank from town square go E, S, E, E, S, S, E, N. Generally speaking 
  it's not necessary to ever withdraw cash from your bank account. Whenever 
  you purchase something, the gold is taken directly from your bank account.
  Also, if you want to give gold to another player you can just transfer
  it to his or her bank account rather than withdrawing the cash and
  giving that to them.

  The Mercantile
  --------------
  In the mercantile you can buy and sell things. Any gold paid to you for
  selling an item is deposited directly into your bank account. Similarly,
  when you purchase an item the gold is debited from your bank account. To
  get the the mercantile from town square go E, S, E, E, S, S, E, S. To
  see what is available for sale, type "catalog". The command to buy
  something is "buy" and to sell something is "sell".

  The Academy
  -----------
  The academy is where you train for enhancements to your character (more on
  this later). To get to the academy from town square, go E, S, E, E, S, S
  E, E, go academy.

  The Player Arena
  ----------------
  The player arena is a room where players can place wagers on each other
  and engage in personal combat without risking actually "dying". New
  players needn't worry about the arena, experienced players should read
  'help bet' for more information on the arena.

  Water Rooms
  -----------
  In some rooms you are considered to be in water over your heard (i.e.
  drowning). While you stay in such rooms you lose 2 points of fatigue and
  2 body points every second (until you leave or until you die). If you cast
  levitation you can safely float about the water and avoid such damage.

  Fire Rooms
  ----------
  Fire rooms are similar to water rooms in that you lose 2 fatigue points and
  2 body points every second while in them. There is no way to avoid this
  damage (other than by leaving or dying).

  Maps
  ----
  Apart from a map of the streets of Elfhelm, there are no other "official" 
  maps for Swords of Chaos But, they are a good idea nonetheless. Wandering 
  around lost is both frustrating and dangerous. Before you officially embark 
  on improving your character you may wish to spend some time exploring 
  around and making maps.

Items
-----
  
  Generally speaking, there are two ways to get items. You can either
  purchase them from the mercantile (a very limited selection), or you
  can get them from monsters or other players (by either killing or robbing 
  them). Of course, there's always whining and pleading, but that'll usually
  earn you a mace to the face. 

  All items have a couple of common characteristics; they all have a name, 
  i.e. "a flaming Battleaxe". Note that one word in an item's name is 
  capitalized. This is the word you would use to reference a particular 
  item, i.e. "get battleaxe". It is possible to relabel an item by changing
  it's "adjective" (in this case, "flaming"). Use the "label" command to
  do this (this is handy for putting your name on an item you leave in
  a guild or put a label on a container). Also, all items have weight. So 
  depending on your strength and how much something weighs, you may or may 
  not be able to pick it up. To get more information on an item, pick it up 
  ("get" command), and look at it ("look" command).

  Weapons
  -------
  Weapons fall into four different categories (blunt, pole, edged and unarmed
  combat aid). There are also two subclasses of weapon; two-handed and
  "light". A two-handed weapon is generally a large, heavy weapon that
  requires you to hold it with both hands. It is possible to wield a
  two-handed weapon in one hand if your strength is high enough. Light 
  weapons are, for one reason or another, lighter than weapons of a similar 
  ilk (perhaps due to some kind of enchantment or special property). 
  Looking at a weapon will give you a display something like this:
  
  Do? look bat
  It is a flaming Battleaxe - two-handed edged weapon (20 +5)
  Equivalent weight in gold pieces = 1000

  The "20" indicates the base damage factor of the weapon. In this instance,
  hitting a monster with this weapon would do a base of 1-20 (random)
  points of damage. So, the higher the damage factor the more damage you
  can inflict with the weapon. The +5 is an enchantment bonus on the weapon 
  and would be added to your combat bonus. So, the higher the enchantment 
  the better your odds of hitting and the more damage you would do. 

  All weapons have a finite number of "uses". Each time you swing and connect
  with a target, a use is decremented from the weapon. When the number of
  uses falls below 10 you will be informed that the weapon is "cracking".
  Once the number of uses reaches 0, the weapon breaks and is removed from
  your inventory. Enchantments on weapons (weapons with a +x) cause the
  weapons to last longer by occasionally saving a use from being decremented.
  The higher the enchantment bonus, the longer the weapon will last.
  
  The command to wield a weapon is "use". To stop using a weapon you can
  either just "drop" it or "return" it. Drop will put it on the ground
  (probably not desireable). Return will return the weapon to it's
  sheath. The first weapon you use is placed into your right hand. If you
  wield a second weapon it is put into your left hand. The format of the
  return command is "return r" (for right hand) or "return l" (for left
  hand). To see what weapons are in what hands you can either look at
  yourself (look <yourname>) or type "stats".

  Armor
  -----
  There are two types of armor; metallic and non-metallic. Metallic armor
  could be steel chainmail or a bronze breastplate, etc. Non-metallic
  armor could be hardened leather armor or perhaps some magically
  enhanced element (bone, for example). There are several reasons for
  this differentiation. First, non-metallic armor will weigh less than
  metallic armor of similar armor class. Second, it is not possible to
  either cast spells or rob someone while wearing metallic armor. The
  amount of metal present in metallic armor interferes with the wizard's
  ability to tap into the "cosmic energy pool". Similarly, metallic armor
  is too noisy and bulky for thieves who require stealth and freedom of
  movement.

  Looking at some armor will give you a display similar to this:

  Do? look arm
  It is some leather Armor (5 +2) - protection for the body!
  Equivalent weight in gold pieces = 40

  In this case, "5" is the base armor class for the armor. The +2 indicates
  that the armor is enchanted and is added to the base armor class for a
  total armor class of 7. That is, were you to wear this armor your armor
  class would increase by 7. Like weapons, armor has a finite number of
  uses. Whenever an enemy hits you in combat, a use is decremented from your
  armor. Also like weapons, any enchantment bonus on the armor will save uses
  and cause the armor to last longer. To put on armor you "use" it. To take
  it off you "return" it (return a, for armor).

  Shields
  -------
  Shields work exactly like armor, i.e. they add to your armor class. There
  are two subclasses of shield; strapped, and light. Strapped shields are 
  strapped to your arm, thus preventing you from accidentally dropping
  them during combat. Light shields, like light weapons, are comprised of
  special material that make them lighter than other shields of similar
  armor class. To hold up a shield you "use" it. To stop using it you
  "return" it (return s, for shield).

  Magic Devices, Magic Rings and Scrolls
  --------------------------------------
  Chaos has many different magic spells to help you in the game; there
  are spells that heal you when you're wounded, invigorate you when
  you're tired, enchant your weapons and armor, make you tougher and
  faster in combat, inflict damage and woe upon your foes, and so on (see
  'help magic' for a detailed explaination of all the spells). There are
  two ways to invoke a spell; learning the spell from a scroll and casting
  it, or using a magic device.

  Scrolls
  -------
  To "learn" a spell, you must slay the scroll-carrying monster in individual
  combat. That is to say, you must find a monster that carries a scroll
  and then kill it with no help from anyone else (no one besides yourself
  can have attacked the monster). If you accomplish that feat, you immediatly
  learn the spell written upon the monster's scroll. It becomes a permanant
  part of your spell repetoire and can never be taken away from you. To list
  the spells you have learned the command is "spells". Once you have learned
  a spell you can cast it any time you want using the "cast" command, with
  just a couple of exceptions. For each spell, depending on how powerful
  it is, there is a minimum psychic ability requirement. Although you may
  know the proper words and gestures to invoke the spell, it is possible
  that your psychic ability is not high enough to be able to cast it. If
  this is the case, you will be informed when you try casting it how high
  your psychic ability needs to be to cast the spell. Also, each spell
  costs a certain number of magic points to cast. Each time you cast a
  spell, magic points are temporarily subtracted from your total magic
  points. If you don't have enough magic points to cast the spell you
  want, then you have to wait for your magic points to recharge.

  Magic Devices
  -------------
  Magic devices can be used by players to cast spells that they haven't
  yet learned. To use a magic device the command is "use". Devices have
  a finite number of uses, decremented each time the item used. Once the
  number of uses reaches 0 the item vanishes in a puff of smoke.

  Magic Rings
  -----------
  Magic rings are a little different in the way they work. Rather than
  having a number of "uses", they have internal timers. Putting on a
  ring (via the "use" command) invokes the affects of the spell on the
  ring. Once the time expires on a ring, the ring vanishes and it's
  affect is cancelled. For example, wearing a ring of invisibility will
  cause you to be invisible until you either take the ring off or the
  timer on the ring runs out. To remove a ring, just "use" it again.

  Cash
  ----
  You may occasionally find cash when you kill or rob a monster. You carry
  this cash around with you until such time as you go to the bank and
  deposit it.

  Trinkets
  --------
  Trinkets are essentially useless items that you can sell at the mercantile
  for big bucks.

  Containers
  ----------
  Containers are items that can hold other items (i.e. bags, sacks, chests,
  etc). They allow you to carry more items than your normal 20 item limit.
  Containers have a finite number of items, a use being subtracted whenever
  you put an item in. Once the number of uses reaches 0 the container will 
  break, spilling it's contents out on the floor. Magic chests are special 
  containers who's contents become weightless. I.E. you can put 50 suits of 
  armor into a magic chest and it still won't weigh any more than it weighs 
  when it's empty. To put an item into a container use either the "put" or 
  the "drop" command. To take an item out of a container use the "get" 
  command. To see what's in a container just look at it. To dump out the 
  entire contents of a container use the "dump" command.
  
  Keys
  ----
  Keys are special items used to open doors (locked special exits). A key 
  may be just a normal skeleton key, or magical. Magical keys will open any
  lock. Normal keys will only open non-enchanted locks. Keys have a finite
  number of uses and once the number of uses reaches 0 the key breaks.

  Talismans
  ---------
  Talismans are special items that help prevent you from suffering the
  penalties associated with being killed (more on this later).

Monsters
--------
  Monsters are the entities that you encounter in the game that aren't other
  players. They may be human, humanoid, animal or just plain weird. It is
  by killng and/or robbing monsters that you earn the experience points
  necessary to advance your character. There are a variety of factors that
  determine a monster's behavior (looking at a monster will reveal these
  factors to you):

  Alignment
  ---------
  Monsters are all either evil or lawful. Lawful monsters will ignore you
  unless you attack them. Evil monsters will attack you the moment they
  become aware of your presence.

  Level
  -----
  Monsters have the same physical attributes as players (strength, dexterity,
  body points, fatigue points, etc). How high these stats are is determined
  by their "level". This single factor is used to determine all of a 
  monster's stats, so determining a monster's level will go a long way
  towards telling you whether you can take it on or not.

  Magical
  -------
  Certain monsters are magical in nature. This means two things; first,
  they can cast spells (which spells they can cast is determined by their
  level). Also, magical monsters can only be hurt by spells and enchanted
  weapons - non-enchanted weapons will merely bounce off their shimmering
  hides.

  Block/Pursue
  ------------
  Certain belligerant monsters may try to prevent you from picking items
  up from the ground. They may also prevent you from leaving the room, or
  pursue you into the next room if you try to escape from them. Sometimes
  having monsters pursue is a good idea. If the monster you want to kill
  is encountered in a very dangerous room, you can try attacking it and
  getting it to pursue you into a (hopefully) less dangerous room.

  Treasure
  --------
  Most monsters carry treasure that you can take from them by either
  killing or robbing them. The same monster will carry the same few
  items, so if there are items that you particularly like, remember the
  monster they came from. Whether or not a given monster is carrying any
  treasure is randomly determined, so not all monsters may carry treasure
  all the time. Monsters (with the exception of animals) actually wield
  the weapons and wear the armor that they carry, so better equipped
  monsters are more dangerous than monsters without weapons or armor.

  Poison
  ------
  Some monsters are poisonous, i.e. you become poisoned when they hit you.
  Poison is always fatal (and in a very short period of time). The only way
  to get rid of poison is to cast a "purification" spell on yourself. If
  you have been poisoned your Do? prompt will appear in red with a "P"
  next to it, i.e. Do(P)?

  Thievery
  --------
  Some monsters, like players, will attempt to steal things from you. The
  only thing that they can't steal from you is the armor off your back. If
  a monster steals something from you, the only way to get it back is to
  kill the monster or steal it back.

  Soul Drain
  ----------
  Certain horrible monsters have the ability to drain your life forces. When
  they hit you, they actually absorb yor body points into their own body.
  So, if a drainer hits you for 50 points, you go down 50 and they go up 50!

  Burly Guards
  ------------
  Certain more petite and vulnerable monsters (i.e. fair maidens, etc) have
  their own entourage of guards. Attacking such a monster will land you
  in jail, minus your weapons.

  Talking
  -------
  You can talk to monsters using the "talk" command. Generally they don't
  have much to say, with a couple of exceptions. If you talk to The Oracle
  (a permanant monster) he will ask you for a spell you are interested in.
  Then, for a price, he will tell you the name of a monster that carries
  a magical device of that spell. Another permanant monster is The Huntress.
  She is rumoured to live in a cave somewhere in the wilderness surrounding
  Elfhelm. If you talk to her she will ask you to be her champion. If you
  agree, she will set you upon a quest (or quests). If you complete her
  quests she will reward you with a Talisman.

  Fleeing
  -------
  As you become more powerful you will discover that monsters that used to
  put up a fight when you attacked them now just flee the minute you try
  to initiate hostilities. Like players, when monsters flee the tend to
  drop stuff in their haste, so be sure to check the ground for items after
  a monster flees from you. 

Referencing
-----------
  
  Commands that refer to a special exit, monster, item or player require
  that you reference them in your command input. For example:

  Do? smash gate
  Do? get bag
  Do? put sword in chest
  Do? talk guard
  Do? parry joe

  Special Exits
  -------------
  Special exits are referenced by their name. For example:

  You see the palace
  Do? go palace
  You see a bronze gate. It's locked!
  Do? use key on gate

  If you're confused about which word to reference an exit by, just try
  all of them until you find the right one. For example:

  You see the Elfhelm Acadamy
  Do? go elfhelm
  I don't see the 'elfhelm'.
  Do? go academy

  Monsters
  --------
  Monsters are referenced by their name and their number (if there is
  more than one of the same kind of monster in the room). For example:
  
  You see an 2 aciddragons, 3 generals, and a scumbag.
  Do? hit acid
  Do? talk acid 2
  Do? cast blast on general 3
  Do? bash scum

  (Note, 'hit acid' and 'hit acid 1' are the same thing. If you don't
  specify a number, then it's assumed you mean the first one).

  Items on the ground
  -------------------
  Items laying on the ground can be referenced name, name and number, or
  just number. For example:
  
  You see a shortsword, a bag of stuff, and a shortsword. 
  Do? get short   (pick up the first shortsword)
  Do? get short 2 (pick up the second shortsword)
  Do? get 1       (pick up the first item on the ground, the shortsword)
  Do? toss 2      (throw away the second item on the ground, the bag)

  Items in your inventory
  -----------------------
  Items in your inventory can be referenced by name, name and number, or
  just number. For example:
  
  Carrying 4 items:
  1. a shortsword
  2. a bag of stuff
  3. a shortsword
  4. some leather armor
  Do? drop short        (drop the first shortsword)
  Do? sell short 2      (sell the second shortsword)
  Do? cast enchant on 3 (enchant the second shortsword)
  Do? drop 4            (drop the leather armor)

  Items in a container
  --------------------
  Items in a container can be referenced by name, name and number, or just
  number. For example:

  Do? look bag
  Bag contents:
  1. a shortsword
  2. a bag of stuff
  3. a shortsword
  Do? get short from bag    (get the first shortsword from the bag)
  Do? toss short 2 from bag (remove the second shortsword and throw it away)
  Do? get 3 from bag        (get the second shortsword from the bag)
  
  Players
  -------
  Players are either referenced by their name, or in the case of the 
  communication commands (send, etc) by their Chaos "port number". When 
  referencing a player by name you must type that player's full name, it
  cannot be abbreviated. This is to prevent people from accidentally
  attacking each other.

  Abbreviating
  ------------
  Any item name or monster name may be abbreviated to the point of 
  uniqueness. I.E.:

  You see a shell, a shortsword, and a shoshoni.
  You see a sheep and a shepherd.

  'she' is not unique, whereas 'shel', 'shee' and 'shep' are. 'sho' is not 
  unique, whereas 'shor' and 'shos' are.

Hiding and Detection
--------------------

  Staying out of sight is a basic strategy in Chaos. If a monster doesn't
  know you are in a room, it can't attack you, can't stop you from picking
  things up from the floor, can't prevent you from leaving, and so on. So,
  it is valuable to try to remain undetected. The simplest way to get out 
  of sight is to use the "hide" command. Whether or not you find a hiding
  place is determined by your intelligence and the level of cover in the
  room. If you fail to find a hiding place you have to wait a few seconds
  before you can try to hide again. Once you have found a hiding place it
  is assumed that you will stay there. An "h" next to your Do? prompt
  indicates that you are hidden, i.e. Do(h)?

  Monsters that enter a room after you've hidden will not know you are there
  until you perform an action that alerts them to your presence. To see
  whether or not a monster knows about you, just look at it. Virtually
  any overt physical action (dropping something, picking something up,
  performing an attack, leaving the room, etc) will cause all monsters
  in the room to note your presence. If there are evil monsters in the room
  they will then attack you.

  Your first strike on a monster who doesn't know you are in the room
  should usually be a good one. You have an enhanced chance to hit and
  do more than your normal amount of damage (it's a surprise attack!).

  There are a couple of spells that relate to hiding and detection;
  invisibility and stealth. While invisible, a player can enter a room
  without having the monsters there detect him or her. Also, the player
  can pick up items from the floor without having monsters interfere with
  them. Finally, they can leave a room without having monsters try to
  stop them or pursue them.

  Under the affects of stealth, it is possible for a player to perform
  an overt action and still not have monsters in the room become aware
  of their presence. The odds of success are based on the monster's
  intelligence vs. the player's dexterity, along with random chance. So,
  a stealthy player can actually attack a monster from his hiding place
  and not have the monster detect them! (This is an extremely powerful
  ability, perhaps the most powerful ability in the game).

Timers
------

  Chaos is played in "real time". That is to say, most actions require
  a few seconds of real time to pass after you perform them before you
  can perform another action (this is tracked by your "action timer"). Many 
  of the spells are timed as well, in that their affect lasts for a set 
  number of seconds before the spell expires and must be recast. The "timers" 
  command lists any timers currently running on your character (generally 
  from spells).

  The program tells you when your action timer has expired and it's OK to
  go ahead and perform another timed action. When your action timer has
  expired you receive the message "Go!" from the program. Additionally,
  the Go! notification tells you the current state of your body and
  fatigue points (if they are below maximum). This can be handy while in
  the heat of combat since you don't have to manually request a display of
  your health levels.

Combat
------

  There are five basic forms of attack, the commands for them are:

  Hit
  ---
  Hit is a basic attack, with no special bonuses or penalties applied. You
  roll a random number to which your combat bonus is added. The result of
  that is compared to your foe's armor class. If you "win" the roll, then
  you have hit. If you hit, a roll is made for the base damage of the
  weapon (or weapons) you are wielding and finally your combat bonus is
  added to that roll. An additional roll is made to see if you scored
  an excellent hit. If you make that roll, the damage you do is doubled.
  The damage is subtracted from your foe's body points and if they have
  gone below 0, your foe dies. Once killed, a monster is removed from
  the room and any items it has fall to the floor. Regardless of whether 
  or not you hit, you and your opponant both lose fatigue from the attack.
  
  Parry
  -----
  Parry is a defensive attack. The damage you do by parrying is only half
  of what you would normally do, however you are much harder to hit in
  return. Parrying temporarily adds 10 to your armor class. Parrying
  does not cost any fatigue points.

  Greatblow
  ---------
  Greatblow is a "berserk" attack. The damage you do by greatblowing is 
  double what you normally do, however you leave yourself vulnerable to
  counter-strike. Greatblowing temporarily subtracts 20 from your
  armor class (down to a minimum of armor class 0). Greatblowing costs
  more fatigue than hitting.

  Bash
  ----
  Bashing an opponant does not inflict damage, rather it (if successful)
  renders an opponant temporarily unable to do anything (the target's
  action timer is set and it can't perform any actions until it's
  timer runs down to 0). Bashing can be used in a couple of ways. You
  can alternate it with a damage-inflicting attack thus avoiding taking
  damage. Or, two players can gang up on a monster- one player bashing
  and the other hitting for damage.

  Bashing has two levels of success. If partially successful, the target
  is rendered vulnerable (it receives an armor class penalty) and it's
  action timer is set. If totally sucessful, the target is considered 
  "knocked to the ground" and is totally helpless. It is rendered
  vulnerable, it's action timer is set, and it can't otherwise flee
  or evade blows.

  Bashing costs more fatigue than greatblow.

  Offensive Magic
  ---------------
  The fifth form of attack is attack by magic. There are several offensive
  spells, some of which inflict damage on the target and others which make
  it harder for a monster to fight.

  Finish
  ------
  To save yourself a lot of typing you can use the 'finish' command. This
  will turn control over to the computer, i.e. the computer will press the
  attack for you using your most recent attack method. The fight will 
  continue until either you die, the monster dies or you type a new command.
  The computer is smart enough to downgrade your attack method if you do not
  have enough fatigue to perform the most recent type of attack. For example,
  say you greatblow a monster and then type finish. The computer will
  continue to greatblow the monster for you until you don't have enough 
  fatigue for another greatblow, then it will try to hit the monster, and 
  finally, if all else fails, it will simply parry (which costs no fatigue). 
  Once you regenerate enough fatigue for further greatblows, the computer 
  will revert back to greatblowing.

  Fumbling
  --------
  Whenever a player or a monster performs an attack they have a small chance
  of goofing up. This could result in stumbling, tripping, falling down or
  dropping a weapon or shield. The higher your dexterity, the lower the
  likelihood of your messing up. When you are first learning to fight with
  a shield or with two weapons, you also have an increased chance of
  dropping stuff. Once your shield skill level and two weapon skill levels
  become non-negative you will find that you fumble less often when fighting
  using a shield or two weapons.

Fleeing
-------

  The most valuable command in the game is "flee". When you flee you
  throw down any weapons or shield you are currently wielding and run
  to a randomly determined exit. Fleeing is a guaranteed escape, so remember
  to use it when it looks like you're about to die - you'll be glad you did.

Magic
-----
  As previously discussed, players can invoke spells by either learning
  them and using the "cast" command or casting them using magic devices.
  There are many different spells with many different uses. For a complete
  explaination of all the spells see "help magic". 
  
  A note on offensive spells; whenever an offensive spell is cast on a
  target, that target has the opportunity to "dodge" the spell. The chance
  of evading an offensive spell is based on the psychic ability of the
  caster and the dexterity of the target, along with random chance. There
  are three possible outcomes of an attempted dodge; completely dodged means
  nothing happens to the target, the spell missed. Partially dodged means
  that the target almost dodged the spell. The target only suffers a
  weakened version of the offensive spell (usually 1/2 power). Finally,
  if the target completely fails to dodge they must suffer the total
  power of the spell.

  There are a number of "friendly" spells in the game that for one reason
  or other the caster may wish to cancel. This is accomplished using the
  "uncast" command.
  
Becoming More Powerful
----------------------

  Becoming a more powerful player certainly involves acquiring better 
  weapons, armor, shields, magic items, learning spells, and amassing vast 
  quantities of gold. But that's just a small part of the big picture, 
  a means to an end. The real guts of becomming a powerful player is
  raising your character's stats. This is accomplished by "training" 
  and "questing". Training involves going to the Elfhelm Academy,
  selecting the stat (or stats) you want to raise, paying the training
  fee and then questing for experience points. You have 13 different
  stats you can increase in this fashion:

  1.  Strength
  2.  Dexterity
  3.  Constitution
  4.  Psychic Ability
  5.  Intelligence
  6.  Thief Bonus
  7.  Defensive Ability
  8.  Blunt Weapon Bonus
  9.  Unarmed Combat Bonus
  10. Edged Weapon Bonus
  11. Pole Weapon Bonus
  12. Shield Skill
  13. Two Weapon Skill

  Your first step is to get to the Academy. Once inside, use the "quests"
  command to list all the available quests. Each quest has an associated
  training cost (in gold pieces) and a number of experience points you
  must earn to complete the quest. These numbers will increase as your
  stats increase, so initially you should be able to advance rapidly.
  Very high stats will cost you a lot more gold and take a lot more time
  to complete. To select a quest and train for it, use the "train" command.
  The "experience" command will display which quests you are currently on
  and how much more experience you need to complete them.

  Once you've select a quest or quests and trained for them, you are then
  ready to go out and earn the experience points. Except for the thief
  bonus, this involves killing monsters (you earn experience towards a
  thief bonus quest by robbing monsters).

  Experience points awarded for a kill vary depending on the level of the
  monster killed as compared to your character's own stats. The higher
  a monster's level, the more experience is awarded for killing it. 
  Experience you earn is downgraded if the monsters you kill are 
  significantly less powerful than you (and upgraded if the monsters are
  significantly more powerful than you). A good rule of thumb is to start
  out with level 1 monsters (the weakest monsters in the game). Eventually
  the experience you earn by killing them will decrease until finally
  they just run away from you whenever you attack them. Then you can move
  up to level 2 monsters, and then level 3 monsters, and so on (remember,
  look at a monster to see it's level). Of course, that's just a general
  guideline - more skilled and daring players (or players working
  together), may wish to attempt to fight "over their heads".

  As you earn experience, the experience counters for your quests decrement.
  Once you've earned all the required experience for a quest, the quest is
  over. The stat you were questing to increase is incremented and the
  quest vanishes from your "experience" list. If you want to increase that
  stat yet again you must return to the academy and start the cycle again;
  pay the training and earn the experience.

  Whether or not you earn experience from a kill is different for each
  quest and depends on a variety of factors.

  Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Intelligence
  ---------------------------------------------------
  Any kill will earn you experience for these quests. Experience may vary
  up or down based on how your particular stat compares to the monster's
  stat. I.E. if you are questing for intelligence, you earn more experience
  for killing monsters that have higher intelligence than you and less
  experience for monsters that have lower intelligence than you.

  Psychic Ability
  ---------------
  Psychic ability quest experience is awarded when you kill a monster in
  a combat where you hit it with at least one offensive spell. I.E. if
  you kill a monster using only weapons you won't earn experience towards
  a psychic ability quest. However, if you use weapons and also nail it
  with a lightning bolt or a langour spell (both offensive spells), you
  will receive experience towards a psychic ability quest. Note; just
  casting an offensive spell at a monster is not enough, you must actually
  hit it with the spell. If the monster dodges the spell it does not count
  as a successful offensive spell. Spells may be cast either via the cast
  command (spells you have learned) or from magic devices. In terms of a
  psychic ability quest, it doesn't matter how you get the spell off.

  Thief Bonus
  -----------
  As previously mentioned, experience towards a thief quest is awarded for
  successfully stealing items from a monster.

  Defensive Ability
  -----------------
  Any kill will earn you experience towards a defensive ability quest.
  The experience you earn is lowered if you kill monsters that have a
  lower armor class than your total armor class.

  Blunt, Pole and Edged Weapon Bonus
  ----------------------------------
  Any kill will earn you experience towards a weapon bonus so long as you
  are using a weapon of the appropriate type. I.E. to earn experience
  towards an edged weapon bonus quest you must be using an edged weapon. It
  is possible to use two different weapon types and earn experience towards
  both weapon class bonus quests. Experience you earn is downgraded if
  your combat bonus exceeds a monster's armor class (if it was easy to
  hit, you earn less experience).

  Unarmed Combat Bonus
  --------------------
  Any kill will earn you experience towards an unarmed combat bonus quest
  so long as you either aren't wielding any weapons at all or the weapons
  you wield are unarmed combat aids and not pole, blunt or edged weapons.

  Shield Skill
  ------------
  Any kill will earn you experience towards a shield skill quest so long as
  you are fighting while holding a shield.

  Two Weapon Skill
  ----------------
  Any kill will earn you experience towards a two weapon skill so long as you
  are wielding two weapons (writer's note: DUH!)

  Banking Generic Experience
  --------------------------
  If you make kills and you haven't trained for anything (i.e. you're not
  currently questing) you can "bank" up to 32000 "generic" experience
  points. Generic experience is applied the next time you train for either
  a strength, dexterity, constituion or intelligence quest. So, even if you
  haven't trained for anything it's still possible to earn at least some
  experience points for kills you make. However, it's not a good idea to
  spend a lot of time fighting when you haven't trained for anything. When
  earning generic experience, you are only awarded half the experience you'd
  earn if you had actually trained for a quest.

Yelling
-------

  The yell command serves a couple of purposes. First, it can be used to send
  a line of text to people in the rooms that adjoin your current room. Also
  (and more importantly) it can be used to increase the encounter rate of
  a room. Yelling and raising a ruckus just naturally attracts monsters,
  so if that's what you want, yell away. Beware though, if you yell in
  the presence of monsters they will tend to get aggravated and attack you!
  So, the lesson here is to yell when you want monsters to come because
  there aren't any there already.

Hanging Up
----------

  Unlike games similar to Chaos, hanging up (disconnecting from the system) 
  when you're in a tough spot will not save your bacon. If you hang up while
  other players are in a room with you, any monsters you leave behind
  that were attacking you will immediatly switch over to attacking your 
  compatriots. This kind of behavior will quickly earn you a very bad 
  reputation, something that is usually pretty hard to overcome. If you hang 
  up while you are alone in a room (there are no other players present), a 
  snapshot of the room is taken and the next time you sign on you will be 
  right back where you left off. Any monsters and/or items that were in the 
  room when you hung up will still be there, patiently awaiting your return. 
  So, if things get rough, either tough it out or flee - disconnecting won't 
  help.

Bounties and Other Events
-------------------------

  Periodically you will see various messages announcing bounties and other
  random occurances. These occurances provide you with special opportunities.

  Bounties
  --------
  There is always a bounty on. To see what monster is currently under bounty
  use the "bounty" command. When killing monsters under bounty you are 
  awarded double experience. In addition, they carry more powerful and 
  valuable items than otherwise, so you can get items from bounty monsters
  that would be normally only found on much more powerful monsters. Bounties 
  are always on evil monsters. They are randomly determined and last for a 
  finite period of time. Each time the bounty changes a "permanant roving"
  version of the bounty monster is placed into the game. Watch out, it may
  show up anywhere!

  There are various other random occurances that affect the state of monsters 
  in the game which are also displayed with the "bounty" command.

  The Wail of The Banshee 
  ----------------------
  While The Banshee wails, monsters move slower. I.E. A monster's action timer
  is set higher than normal when they perform any kind of action.

  Solar Eclipse 
  ------------
  During an eclipse monsters have fewer body points than they normally would.

  Golden Halo 
  ----------
  While a golden halo rings the sun you earn greater than normal experience 
  for kills.

Dying
------

  Dying is a terrible experience for any adventurer. Here are a couple of
  things to keep in mind about dying:

  When you die you lose any items or cash you were carrying and are
  teleported via "the coffin express" back to Town Square.

  If other players are present in the room when you die, your items are
  scattered to the ground and it is up to the players left behind to either
  retrieve them for you or "hold" the room until you can return and pick them
  up (remember, all items vanish from a room when the last player leaves).

  If there were no other players present when you died, your body (and 
  consequently your items), will remain in the room until you (or another
  player) returns to the scene of the crime to retrieve them.

  Dying also causes you to lose 1 point from each of your physical 
  attributes (str, dex, con, int and psy). If your constitution goes below 2, 
  your character is permanantly dead and you must start over with a new one. 
  Note, some of your other statistics are computed based on your 5 physical
  attributes- body points, fatigue and magic points. So, when you die and
  lose 1 point each from your physical attributes, your BP's, fatigue and
  MP's will also go down.
  
  Talismans can be used to prevent this stat loss. For each talisman you 
  carry you will save one randomly determined stat from being decremented. 
  The downside is that you will not be able to retrieve your items if killed 
  while holding talismans (the gods take your inventory rather than your
  stats). Talismans can be found on a wide variety of different monsters, 
  though they are somewhat rare. Talismans can also be had by completing 
  quests for The Huntress (if you ever find her, she'll tell you what you 
  have to do).

  Finally, when you die any training/questing that you had undertaken and not 
  yet completed is lost. You must retrain and begin those quests anew.

Customized Options
------------------

  There are a number of special options for your character that you may
  toggle on and off. To list your current special options and their
  setting, type "options". To toggle them on and off, use the "setoption"
  command. The special options you can set are:

  1 - Ignore "global" chaos messages. If you turn on this option, you will
      no longer receive global messages such as people signing on to the
      game, signing off the game, global sends from other players, and so
      on. If you're intent on the game and don't want a bunch of messages
      that you don't care to see, turn this option on.

  2 - Display only the first line (or first sentence) of room descriptions.
      If you're familiar with the terrain and don't want to see full
      room descriptions, turn this option on.

  3 - Disable the 'flee' command. Fleeing causes you to lose the weapons
      and or shield that you currently wield. If you're afraid that you
      might accidentally mistype 'flee' when you didn't really want to
      flee, then turn this option on. When turned on, typing 'flee' as
      a command is ignored.

  4 - Don't tell me when people spy on me. When someone casts the "spying"
      spell on you, you receive the message "You feel like you're being
      watched". If you don't care whether or not people are spying on you
      and don't care to receive that message, turn this option on.

  5 - Don't want to be accepted into guilds. If you don't want people to
      accept you into their guild against your will, turn this option on.

  6 - Give me turf messages. If you belong to a guild and want to see
      who owns the turf you're currently on, turn this option on. The
      turf status (owner, challenger, kills) will be displayed when the
      rest of the room description is displayed.

OK, So Let's Play!
------------------

  To get started, the first thing you will want to do is visit the Elfhelm 
  Mercantile. In the Mercantile you can outfit yourself with weapons and
  armor (and later on, you can sell your ill-gotten booty there).

  Once inside the mercantile, type 'catalog' for a list of available items. 
  You will want to buy a weapon. For example, to buy a scimitar enter 'buy 1' 
  (1 is the catalog number for a scimitar). You may also want to buy yourself 
  some armor and/or a shield. Once accomplishing this, you will want to use 
  the weapon. To do so you would enter 'use scimitar' (if that's what you 
  bought). If you bought armor or a shield, you also need to "use" them. 
  Type "stats" or "look yourname" to verify that you are outfitted and ready
  to go.

  Next you will want to go to the Elfhelm Academy and train for some stat
  quests. They're all valuable, but the best quests to start with are
  strength and constitution. As those stats increase so do your body
  points and fatigue points (allowing you to survive more and more
  dangerous combat). To get to the academy from the mercantile type "out",
  "east" and then "go academy". Once inside type "quests" for a list of
  available quests or just type "train 1" and "train 3" to train for
  strength and constitution quests.

  The mall just outside the mercantile is a good place to start out. The 
  monsters that show up there are low level (i.e. not very powerful) and 
  carry a lot of cash. From the mercantile, just type 'out' to go into the 
  mall. Hiding helps you in combat and thievery, so type 'hide' once you get 
  into the mall. Now you just have to wait for something to show up.

  When something shows up (You encounter a merchant!), you can then attack it 
  by either entering 'greatblow merchant', 'hit merchant', or 'parry 
  merchant' (or substitute merchant for whatever the monster you encounter
  is called). Be sure to look at a monster before you attack it to find out
  it's level (i.e. "look merchant"). When just starting out you should stick
  to monsters that are level 1 (the weakest monsters there are).

  After swinging at the monster, your action timer is set and you must wait a 
  few seconds before you can swing again. When you can press the attack, you 
  will get the message 'Go!' from the program. Once you have started an 
  attack, you don't have to specify the monster name anymore. I.E.:

  You encounter a merchant!
  Do(h)? hit merchant
  You hit the merchant for 4 damage points!
  Do? parry
  Next action in 4 seconds.
  Go!
  Do? parry
  You killed the merchant!
  You earned 100 experience points!
  On the merchant you find:
  a Bag of gems
  a Pouch of gold

  After you have defeated the monster, you can take the treasure it had (if 
  any) by using the 'get' command. In the above example, you would enter 'get 
  bag' and 'get pouch'.

  To deposit gold you find into your bank account, enter the bank by going
  north from the mall and type 'deposit'. To sell items that you find, go back 
  to the mercantile and use the 'sell' command (i.e. 'sell bag').

  If you don't want to start out right away with combat, you can also try to
  to rob monsters to get items that you can sell for gold (or even steal their
  cash). To steal from a monster use the "rob" command; i.e. "rob official" or 
  "rob shopkeeper". Beware, if you're caught you will be attacked!

  The Bank and The Mercantile are "safe havens". This means that nothing can
  hurt you there. So, if it looks like you're about to die you can enter
  a safe haven and thwart your attackers (or just type "flee" to run away
  in a flaming panic).

  Be sure to keep an eye on your experience (use the "experience" command). 
  Once you have completed your first quests you need to back to the academy
  and train for more. And on it goes, your quest for power!

    Trade Wars 2002 v2
    ------------------

    Trade Wars is a space-based game where you become the pilot of a
    shiny new cruiser.  At first, you start only with your ship, your
    wits, and a few credits to get you started, it is up to your
    trading skills to make money.  By purchasing items from the
    starports and re-selling them where they are in greater demand, you
    can make money to purchase new ships, fighters, space mines,
    scanners, and a host of other equipment!  You can join up with 
    other players to form teams, create planetary citadels, and even 
    become a member of the elite FedPolice.

    /RECENT Global Command
    ----------------------

    Type /RECENT at any prompt to see a list of the most recent users to
    logoff the system.


    Super LOTTO
    -----------

    In this module, you can purchase lotto tickets, each of which is
    comprised of a special sequence of numbers that you select.  Each lotto
    ticket you buy, you buy with credits you have on-hand, and those
    credits are immediately added to the day's "pot".  This pot accumulates
    all day long -- every time a user buys a ticket, the price of that
    ticket is added to the pot.

    Every night, a winning ticket is drawn.  If any of your tickets match
    the winning one (the order of the numbers doesn't matter), you win the
    entire pot!  (If more than one user has the matching numbers, the pot
    is divided evenly between the winners.)


                 Major Agenda By ProDesign, Inc.
                         505-293-9045


The following functions and capabilities are available to all clients
on the system:

Viewing Major Agenda Events

After selecting Major Agenda you will be presented with a calendar
display. On that calendar you will notice several buttons (RIP Mode) or
the days of the month (ASCII/ANSI Mode) that can be selected to allow
you access to various event messages.

View by Month and Day

By selecting one of the months on the calendar display you will be able
to view up to 1 year's worth of events messages. That year is
calculated from the current date up to 365 days in advance.

The current month will always be available in the upper left corner of
the display. The next 11 months are displayed from left to right in the
first and second row of buttons.

As you select a month, days which contain events will be highlighted on
your screen. In ASCII/ANSI  mode a "!" will appear next to any date
with an event. Selecting a highlighted day will bring up a display of
available event categories.

Once again, those categories which contain events will be designated by
a highlighted button or tagged day.  Selecting one of the days will
cause a list of available event topics to be displayed.

In order to view the full description of the event, select the topic
bar with your mouse button or the number of the event (ASCII/ANSI
mode). At this point the complete event message will be displayed.

After reading the message you have the option to reply directly, via
E-mail, to the person who originated the event message. Select the
E-mail command or Exit to return to the list of event topics.

Adding an Event

It's easy to add an event to the calendar. Just select the MONTH and
DAY in which the event will occur. At this point you will be display a
listing of available categories.

Select an event category by selecting the ADD BUTTON next to the
category title (RIP Mode) or select the category number followed by the
ADD command.

Events to ALL Users

Now that you have selected the ADD command, you can designate who will
be able to view your event message.

By typing a <RETURN>, your event will be available to ALL users on the
system.

Events to a Single User

If you want only one other person on the system to view the event,
simply enter their USERID at the prompt. This will allow only that
specified user to view the event.

Events to Yourself

One of the best features of Major Agenda is that you can use it to
schedule your own private event messages.  This is really nice for
personal schedules like doctor appointments, interviews, dates, just
about anything you can think of that correlates to a DATE in time.

When using Major Agenda for your own personal events, it doesn't matter
what category you post the event message on. Just make sure that you
enter your own USERID and you will be the only one who can see the
message!

    Registry of Users
    -----------------

    The registry allows you to put information online for other users to
    view.  This is optional.  You may want to remain confidential or
    anonymous on the BBS and there's usually no penalty for doing so.  By
    the way, the questions you answered when you signed up are for the
    Sysop only.  See him or her if you have any confidentiality concerns.

    When you create your own entry in the registry, you type in the answers
    to several questions.  The operator of the BBS can configure his own
    set of questions.  The last one is always a "summary" question.  If you
    don't want to answer a question, you can always enter "N/A".

    You can scan a list of users alphabetized by User-ID, and see their
    summary lines.  Also, you can look up other users directly by User-ID.
    Of course, you'll only see information on users who have voluntarily
    answered the registry questions.


    D - Directory Search

    Use this command to list out the users that have answered the registry
    questions.  You may start anywhere in the alphabet you please, and only
    the User-ID and summary line will appear for each user.


    L - Looking up Another User

    This is used to look up a specific user's registry.  You will be able
    to view the user's answers to all registry questions.  If you don't
    know the exact User-ID you want to look up, just enter what you know,
    and the BBS will try to find an exact match for you.


    Y - Creating or Editing Your Entry

    When you create your entry, you answer the registry questions one after
    the other.  Each answer has a limited number of characters it can
    accept.  To find out how many, you can just type a long line until you
    run into the limit.

    After creating your entry, you can go back later and edit your answers.


    Teleconference Link-Up
    ----------------------

    Teleconferencing is like a conference room where people gather to
    present and exchange information, or to chat socially.  The
    multi-channel feature makes it like a vast building of conference
    rooms.  There's the "main" channel, where everyone can meet, there's a
    channel for each Forum (for special, Forum-related discussions), and
    there's even a private channel for every, single user!

    Teleconferencing simply allows several users to converse with one
    another over their terminals.  When you type something, a message goes
    out to all the other users in the same teleconference channel telling
    them what you said.

    This teleconference is different from any others in many ways, one of
    which is its ability to "link" to other teleconferences around the
    world, connecting teleconferencing sessions between different BBS
    systems.  Another way this teleconference is different is its use of
    "actions" -- you have the ability to express certain actions to other
    users in your channel.  You can hug users, kiss them, kick them, or
    even smack them.  You just type the action, followed by the User-ID you
    want the action to apply to (or even "all").  You can use actions to
    just plain express yourself:  entering just "smile" will let everyone
    else in your channel know you're smiling joyfully.  For a list of all
    the available action commands, enter "action list".

    In the teleconference, you get a colon (:)  for a prompt.  When you
    type a message and hit RETURN, that message is broadcast to all other
    users on the same teleconference channel (if it's not an action or a
    special command).

    All of the special commands available in the Teleconference Link-Up are
    described here.  Each command has a longhand and a shorthand form.  To
    un-type a command you may either use the backspace key several times,
    or end the command with the caret (^) character -- the entire command
    will be ignored.


    <Return>

    This will let you know who else is on your current channel by listing
    their User-IDs.  A "forgotten" user (see the "FORGET" command) will
    appear with an "(F)" next to his User-ID.


    WHISPER TO <User-ID> <Message>
    /<User-ID> <Message>

    Using the "whisper" command, you can send a message to just one other
    user -- no other users in your teleconference channel will be the
    slightest bit aware of the exchange.


    USERS
    #

    Displays a list of all the users currently logged onto the system, and
    the name of the module they are working in.


    ?
    /?

    Display a list of the commands available in the teleconference.


    X
    /X

    This takes you out of the teleconference, back to The Major BBS main
    menuing system.  If you come back to the teleconference before logging
    off, you will be in the same channel.


    EDIT
    /E

    Invokes the Teleconference Profile Editor.  The editor will permit you
    to configure your usage of the teleconference.  Some of the things you
    can edit are:

     o  Is ACTION turned on or off when you log on?
     o  By default, do you allow others to page you (and how often)?
     o  When you first log on, what's your private channel's topic?


    MAIN
    /M

    Returns you to the main channel from a private or Forum channel.


    SCAN
    /S

    Show a directory of the other users in Teleconferencing, and what
    channel they're on (i.e. main channel, private channel, or Forum
    channel).  If you have "forgotten" or "invited" any of the other users
    on the system, it will be noted in the SCAN.


    INVITE <User-ID>
    /I <User-ID>

    You may invite another user to "JOIN" your private channel.  The other
    user is so notified.  The invitation remains in effect for as long as
    the other user is on the system.

    A special use of this command is "INVITE ALL" or "/I ALL".  This will
    permit any user logging on to the system to enter into your private
    channel.


    JOIN <channel name>
    /J <channel name>

    You type this to switch channels.  The channel name may be:  "MAIN" for
    the main channel; the name of a Forum for a Forum channel; the User-ID
    of another on-line user, to switch to their private channel (see
    "INVITE", above); or the channel name may be omitted, to switch to your
    own private channel.


    UNINVITE <User-ID>
    /U <User-ID>

    You do this to uninvite another user from your private channel.  If the
    unwanted user is already in your channel, then the user is forcibly
    returned to the main channel.  He will no longer be able to enter your
    private channel.

    A special use of this command is "UNINVITE ALL" or "/U ALL".  This will
    have the affect of cancelling the "INVITE ALL".  Any users currently in
    your channel will remain there.  In order to remove users from your
    private channel, you'll have to uninvite them one at a time.


    FORGET <User-ID>
    /F <User-ID>

    This command allows you to completely ignore another user.  Any
    messages, whispers, chat requests, and actions will not be received.
    The "forgotten" user will be notified of this each time that he does a
    directed action (a message or action specifically directed at you).
    Forgotten users still show up in the "SCAN" and "<Return>" commands.


    REMEMBER <User-ID>

    This command will reverse the effects of a "FORGET" command.  The named
    user will again be able to make direct contact with you.


    ACTION <On/Off/?/List>
    /A <On/Off/List>

      On  Puts you in "action" mode.  Action commands from you will have
          colorful effects.

     Off  Puts you in normal teleconference mode.  Action commands are
          transmitted to other users literally.

       ?  Displays a brief help message on the "action" feature.

    List  Will display a list of the valid "action" words.


    CHAT <User-ID>
    /C <User-ID>

    "Chat mode" is where two users can converse directly with one another.
    Each keystroke from one user is immediately echoed to both users.  To
    request someone join you in chat, simply use this command.  The other
    user will be able to accept by using this same command.


    PAGE <On/Off/Ok>
    /P <On/Off/Ok>

     On   This will allow others to page and request youo in chat, but not
          more often than your current "page/chat interval" allows.

    Off   This will not allow others to page you or request you in chat.

     Ok   This will allow others to page and request you in chat as often
          as they wish.


    PAGE <User-ID> <message>
    /P <User-ID> <message>

    The "PAGE" command broadcasts a message to another user who is not in
    the teleconference (or not on the same channel).  The command may be
    used to send a special message to the other user.  If <message> is
    omitted, the command will simply request the user's presence in the
    teleconference channel from which the page command was entered.  If the
    page does not go through, the sender is so notified.

    Use the /P form of this command when you want to page someone from
    somewhere other than the teleconference.

    If you page the Sysop when the Sysop is not on-line, your page (and
    your message, if any) will be displayed on the Sysop's main console.


    TOPIC <channel topic>
    /T <channel topic>

    This command sets the topic for your private channel.  The "SCAN"
    command shows the topic of each channel with users in it.  Using this
    command without a <channel topic> erases the topic.


    Playing Blackjack

    Tele-Blackjack is the game of 21, in which the players compete against
    each other to win the "pot" -- the sum of all of the players' bets
    minus a "house cut".  Aces count as either 1 or 11, and the person
    whose hand comes closest to 21 without busting (going over) wins the
    game.  If enough users request to play, the game will automatically
    begin, and proceed via normal Blackjack rules.  In the event of a push
    (tie), the pot is divided among the winners.

    To list all of the Teleconference Blackjack commands, just type "bj
    help" from inside the Teleconference.


    Playing Poker

    Tele-Poker is standard five-card draw Poker, interfaced with The Major
    BBS teleconference.  Players ante and bet their online credits, and the
    winner of the hand wins the "pot" -- the sum of all bets made by the
    players, minus a "house cut".  If enough users want (request) to play,
    the game will begin automatically, and proceed via normal Poker rules.
    (Aces are high, not low.)

    For more information about the poker commands, just enter "poker help"
    from inside the Teleconference.


    Playing Tingo

    TINGO is a Bingo-style game interfaced with The Major BBS
    teleconference.  If enough users online "request" to play, the game
    will begin automatically and play will continue until one user wins by
    getting five marked spaces in any row, column, or diagonal.  The
    winning user (or "users" if two or more users get TINGO at the same
    time) is given a credit prize, automatically.

    Once in the Teleconference, simply type "tingo help" to get information
    about the commands available.


    SuperNova
    ---------

    Your mission is, simply put, destroy the enemy's galaxy before he
    destroys yours.  You do this by entering sector coordinates where you
    wish to detonate your SN-101 Hydroplasmatic Antimatter Destruct
    (H.A.D.) bomb.  This bomb is capable of destroying entire planetary
    solar systems by causing their sun to explode into a supernova.

    Each of you will be given a chance to hide your stars.  You have five
    stars to hide (making up your galaxy).  When your galaxy is destroyed
    (when your opponent hits all five stars), you lose.

    You will see two grids on your screen:

              YOU             OPPONENT
         1  2  3  4  5      1  2  3  4  5
       .---------------.  .---------------.

     4 | .  .  .  *  . |  | .  .  .  .  . |
     5 | .  .  .  .  * |  | .  .  .  .  . |
       `---------------'  `---------------'

    The asterisks (*) on your grid indicate the locations that you chose to
    hide your stars.  The player who completes the hiding of his stars
    first gets the first shot.

              YOU             OPPONENT
         1  2  3  4  5      1  2  3  4  5

     5 | .  .  .  .  * |  | .  .  .  .  . |
       `---------------'  `---------------'

    On the opponent's grid:

    O - Indicates you guessed this sector and missed.

    X - Indicates you guessed this sector and hit one
        of his five stars causing it to go supernova.

              YOU             OPPONENT
         1  2  3  4  5      1  2  3  4  5

     5 | .  .  .  .  * |  | .  .  .  .  . |
       `---------------'  `---------------'

    On your grid:

    O - Indicates your opponent guessed this sector and missed your stars.

    X - Indicates your opponent guessed the correct sector of one of your
        five stars and destroyed it.


    Score

    Your score is based on the number of games played, number of games won
    and the number of kills you have.  The chart below displays the best
    score and the worst score:

        BEST ====>   100.0
                        .
                        .
        WORST ===>     0.0

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Using the Forum Selector

This system carries several different discussion forums, each with its
own topic. If you want to read the messages in a specific forum, you'll
have to select that forum first. We've tried to make this as easy as
possible. Here's how to do it:

From the forum menu, choose the option: "[S]elect a forum"

What happens after that depends on the terminal emulation of your
communication program.

- If your terminal program has an ANSI emulation and you've configured
  your account on the system to use ANSI, the system will ask you where
  to start displaying the forums. If you are searching for a specific
  forum, you can enter the first characters. If you know the exact name
  of the forum, then just type it in and that forum is selected. The
  system will notify you of that.
  If you don't know the name of the forum, just enter a question mark.
  At this point, you are placed into the full screen forum selector. On
  your screen, you will see up to sixteen different forums along with a
  little selection bar. There can be different kinds of forums and they
  will show up in different colors. You will also notice that some forum
  names are highlighted. Those forums are already part of your
  'Quickscan'.
  You can move the selection bar by using the arrow keys on your
  keyboard. There are two ways to select a forum now:
  1)  You can move the selection bar to the forum of your choice and hit
      the Enter key.
  2)  You can type the letter in front of the forum of your choice.
  By using the CTRL-N and CTRL-P key combination (first press down the
  Control-key and then the character) you can see the next or previous
  sixteen forums. Use X if you want to exit the selector without
  selecting a new forum.

- If your communication program doesn't support ANSI, things are a
  little different. After you have selected the [S] option, the system
  will still ask you where to start. Use the same technique described
  above. The system will list the next sixteen forums. You can select a
  forum by typing in the character in front of the forum name and
  hitting the Return or Enter key. If you don't type a character, but
  just hit Return, the next page of forums will be shown. Use "X" and
  <Return> to abort the selection. On the list of forums, you will
  notice that some forums are marked with an asterisk. Those forums are
  part of your Quickscan.

- If your communication program supports RIP-script, you will see a list
  of forums. Just point and click on the forum of your choice. At the
  bottom of the screen you'll find buttons for the next or previous page
  of forums.
  You'll notice that the buttons with the forum names can have two
  different colors. The 'Red' forums are part of your Quickscan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       Configuring your Quickscan

This system carries several different discussion forums, each with its
own topic. Of course, you won't be interested in every single topic.
That's why the system allows you to tell which topics (forums) you would
like to read. The list of forums that you want to read is called your
Quickscan. When you first signed up, the system gave you a default
Quickscan, but you're allowed to adjust it to your own taste. In the
Forum menu, you will find an option "Configure Quickscan". What happens
after you select this option depends on the terminal emulation of your
communication program:

-   If your terminal program supports ANSI, the system will show you the
    same 'Selector' as when selecting a forum. The forums in your
    Quickscan are in highlighted text while the others are shown in
    normal color intensity.
    Just hit the space bar to add or remove a forum to or from your
    Quickscan. When you add a forum to your Quickscan, the message
    read-pointer is set a couple of days back. This allows you to pick
    up the various discussions pretty easily.
    If you want to set the message read-pointer to the first message in
    the forum, use the '<' key instead of the space bar.
    If you want to set the message read-pointer to the very last message
    in the forum, use the '>' key instead of the space bar.
    At the top of the first page of forums, you'll notice some 'Forum
    Groups'. This system has grouped several forums together, making it
    easier to configure your Quickscan. If you want to add all the
    forums of a particular forum group to your Quickscan, move the
    selection bar to that forum group and hit the '+' key. If you want
    to remove all the forums of a group from your Quickscan, move the
    selection bar to that forum group and hit the '-' key.

-   If your terminal program only supports ASCII (you better upgrade),
    things are a little different. When you select the Quickscan
    configure option, the system will show you one page of forums. The
    forums marked with an asterisk (*) are part of your Quickscan. To
    add or remove a forum to or from your Quickscan, press the character
    in front of the forum name.

    At the top of the first page of forums, you'll notice some 'Forum
    Groups'. This system has grouped several forums together, making it
    easier to configure your Quickscan. If you want to add all the
    forums of a particular forum group to your Quickscan, type the
    character in front of that group followed by a '+' sign. If you want
    to remove all the forums of a group from your Quickscan, type the
    character in front of the forum group followed by a '-' sign.

-  If your terminal software supports RIP-Script the system will place
   sixteen buttons with forum names on your screen. Forums that are
   already part of your Quickscan are shown in red. To add or remove a
   forum to or from your Quickscan, just select that forum with your
   mouse pointer. You'll notice an instant color change that notifies
   you that forum has been toggled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Your Personal Mail Assistant

Wouldn't it be nice if you're out of town for a while, the system
automatically notifies everybody who sends you E-mail that you're out of
town? Well ... it *IS* possible!!

In the Mail menu, you will find an option that will bring you to your
personal mail assistant. There are several options to choose from there.
First of all, there's an option that will give you some general
information about the usage of the assistant. Please check that first;
it might contain information not written in this manual.
The next thing to select is the menu option that will show you the
credit charges of the various services. After you're familiar with that,
you can start using the options.

The [S]how option will show you your current configuration. To change
it, you'll need to select the [C]hange option. After you hit the Return
key, the system will fire up the data-entry screen. Here are the options
you can change:

- Activate: (YES, NO or COPY_ONLY)
       There are two active-modes of the E-mail responder. The first
       (YES) will activate all the options, the second (COPY-ONLY) will
       only activate the copy-option. The option NO will turn them all
       off.

- Away Until: (MM/DD/YY)
       If you set the above option to ON, you'll have to specify the
       date you expect to be gone away until and you'll be out of town.
       On this date, the E-Mail responder will turn itself off and
       notify everybody who sent you a message of your return (if you
       have selected the "I'm Home" option).

- Use default msg: (hit space to toggle)
       When somebody sends you an E-Mail message, the system will notify
       that person that you're out of town for a while. There are two
       kind of messages the system can send: the default message or a
       message you define. Set this option to NO if you want to write
       your own personal message to be sent out in an automated reply.

- Copy incoming E-Mail: (hit space to toggle)
       If you want to let the system copy every messages sent to you in
       E-mail to another address, answer YES to this question.

- Address to copy to:
       If you answered YES to the above question, you'll have to specify
       the address to which you want to copy your E-Mail to. This
       address can be a local user, an user outside the system (on
       Majornet, Internet, Fido and so on) or a fax-number (if you have
       access to those functions). To specify a fax address, use the
       following format:

                     FAX: Name-of-person@faxnumber

       For example "FAX: President Clinton@(305)999-1234

- Send I'm home msgs: (hit space to toggle)
       The system keeps a list of everybody who sent you a message while
       you were away. If you set this option to YES, all those friends
       will get a message that you're back in town.

If you've configured the E-Mail responder to send a personal message,
don't forget to enter that message!!

                                  BladeMaster

                           Copyright (c)1992 Logicom

     Welcome to BladeMaster, an arena combat simulation.  Here you are
     pitted against the most vile of opponents, some as human as yourself,
     while others are made from the fabric of nightmares.  You begin your
     quest for glory with only a hundred and fifty gold to your name and a
     loin cloth on your body.  Your pay is one hundred gold coins per day.

     Around you are many important sights which play a role in your ongoing
     quest.  These places are:

     (A) Arena:  These looming gates beckon you to either destruction or
         untold riches.  Each fight is to the death, although there are
         certain divine forces which can reclaim your soul from Charon,
         before he can ferry it across the River of Death (see Healer).
         The Arena is where all of the fighting in the game takes place.
         It is highly advisable to examine the other sights of the town
         proper before making your way into this death zone.  More
         information on the Arena is supplied towards the end of this
         documentation.

     (H) Healer:  Inside this shop, rich with the aromatic scent of magical
         herbs, rests the powerful Healer of the city.  For a relatively
         small cost in gold, the Healer will restore some or all of your
         lost hit points.  If, for whatever reason, you die in a battle,
         the Healer will restore you back to life for a fairly modest fee.
         The Healer can also remove unhealthy toxins from your body, or
         cure you of vile diseases which some of the more hideous Arena
         monsters may inflict on you.

     (T) Tavern:  Filled with whispered rumors, gossip, and other
         strangeness, the Tavern represents a place of much needed rest for
         those who spend their lives (typically short ones) fighting in the
         Arena.  You can purchase assorted mugs of wine and other exotic
         drinks.  The bartender has a trained ear for hearing information,
         so a few gold in his direction might be worth your while.  Be
         wary, heavy drinking can lead to very short adventuring.

     (W) Weapons Shoppe:  This place supplies you with all of your weapon,
         armor, and projectile needs.  Shrewd shopkeepers are not beyond
         haggling for better prices.  It is wise to purchase both better
         arms and armor immediately before setting into the Arena.  The
         shopkeepers here will also purchase your weapon or armor should
         you be in need of some quick gold.  Again, heavy bargaining is
         advisable to gain the best price for your goods.

     (+) This option allows you to deposit gold in magically sealed vaults,
         protecting your investment from virtually all harm.  It is
         EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to keep enough gold in the bank to compensate
         for resurrection costs.  If you are challenged while you are gone,
         and lose, all money on hand (NOT in the bank) will be awarded to
         the winner of the battle.  Resurrection will automatically fail if
         you do not have enough money on hand or in the bank.  Make it a
         habit to deposit your gold before you leave the game.  More
         information on resurrection costs can be found in the COMBAT
         section of this documentation.

         You will also receive one percent of your current balance in
         interest each day.  The more you have in the bank, the more
         interest you get!

     (-) This option allows you to withdraw gold from the magically sealed
         vault.


     NOTE:  Both the (H)ealer and banking options (+,-) can be accessed
     from the town menu and the Arena menu.


     MAIN MENU:
     ----------

     When you first accessed the game, you should have seen a menu with the
     following options:

     (I) Instructions:  This is what you are looking at now.

     (B) BladeMasters:  This list shows the immortal BladeMasters; those
         who have achieved a level rank of 500 or more.

     (H) High Scores:  This list shows the current, most powerful warriors
         in BladeMaster, and it also keeps a record of those, if any, who
         have aspired beyond the call of duty and have attained the nearly
         divine rank of being a BladeMaster themselves.  These incredible
         warriors shall remain immortalized here in this list as long as
         the game remains on your system.

     (L) Log of Battles:  This shows a history of battles fought by the
         other Arena contenders.

     (O) Set Player Options:  This allows you to configure a number of
         important settings in the game.  These are:

         Attack Phrase:  Your battle cry or vengeful warning to anyone who
                         attacks you.

         Losing Phrase:  Your hideous curse or pitiful plea to anyone who
                         defeats you.

         Monitor Type :  If your computer can support ANSI, select whether
                         you have a color or monochrome monitor.

         Music On/Off :  This option allows you to hear music and other
                         sound effects if your communications software
                         supports BBS music playing (Qmodem is one
                         example).  If you are getting strange strings of
                         numerical codes during game play your comm program
                         probably does not support this type of music.

     (P) Play:  Selecting this option will take you into the game, to begin
         or continue your epic adventure to fame and glory.


     THE ARENA
     ---------

     Once you have taken your first step into the Arena, you will catch a
     glimpse of nine groups of snarling opponents.  These opponents are
     ranked accordingly:

               Human/Demihuman     Humanoid/Nonhuman
               ---------------     -----------------
               Ruffians            Monsters
               Mercenaries         Creatures
               Champions           Netherbeasts
               Sorcerers           Extra Planar Creatures
               Heroes

     Lower level players will find it safe to stick with Ruffians and a
     occassional mercenary.  While some Monsters are not that difficult,
     there are a few which will easily devastate any lower level opponent.

     To select the group of opponents you wish to choose from, use the
     cursor keys.  The list of opponents should appear on the upper right
     hand of your screen.  At the bottom of your screen, you should see the
     Healer and banking (+, -) options.  These can be accessed any time
     while in the Arena, except in the middle of a battle.


     COMBAT
     ------

     WARNING!!!  - Severe penalties will be imposed on those who drop
     carrier in the middle of a battle.  For starters, your opponent wins
     by default, and you are credited with a loss in your stats.  In
     addition, you lose ALL the gold you have on hand, and half the gold
     you had accumulated in the bank.

     After you have selected the group of opponents to choose from, the
     computer will randomly pick one of dozens or more creatures from that
     group to face you in battle.  As you attain higher levels, more than
     one creature will appear.

     The Arena display is shown in the upper right hand section of your
     screen, in place of the monster group list you had just selected from.
     You should see a rectangular box, with a single hole in its outline.
     This hole is the exit of the Arena -- the only means of escape, short
     of death, if your opponent should prove too difficult for you to
     handle.  The statistics for your character appear on the left hand
     side of the screen.  Just below them on the lower left, you will note
     the name of your opponent, his weapon, range weapon, armor, and a
     battle quote.  It is possible for your opponent to have more than one
     weapon or range weapon.  If this is the case, only the one currently
     in action will be displayed.  Lastly, two health bars will appear just
     below the graphic display of the Arena.  The longer the bar, the more
     health you or your opponent has.  As wounds are inflicted, the bar
     will grow shorter.  Use the bar to judge the strength of your opponent
     and whether or not one more desperate swing might be worth facing
     death over.

     In battle, you can use your numeric keypad to move around.  If you do
     not have a numeric keypad, the numbers 1-9 on the top of your keyboard
     serve as movement.  Alternately, you can use the eight keys
     surrounding the letter "H" on your keyboard, with "H" representing the
     "pass" command.

     In combat, you have the following battle commands:

     (A) Attack with melee weapon:  This allows you to swing your melee
         weapon at your opponent, providing he is in an adjacent square.
         Just select this option and follow it with the direction of your
         opponent.  If your opponent is invisible, then guesswork might be
         in order.  If you tarry too long before selecting the direction of
         your attack, it is possible that your opponent might actually move
         to another adjacent square.  KEEP WATCHING before you select this
         option, as a swing at empty air will hit only empty air.  Also
         note that this option will only appear when you have an attack
         available.  After using it, you must wait until the end of the
         phase before it will appear again.  As you gain higher levels, you
         should see the Attack option appearing more and more often.  The
         "Attacks Per Phase" number on your character statistics reflects
         this.  Many of your opponents, particularly the higher level ones,
         will have more than one attack per phase.

     (F) Fire range weapon:  This option is particularly useful, as it
         allows you to damage your opponent without actually getting close
         up into melee range.  If you have a ranged weapon, experiment
         until you find out exactly how far it can shoot.  This is
         graphically displayed either in ANSI or ASCII when you fire.  Once
         you've learned the maximum range, try to stay that far away from
         your opponent and pelt him will arrows or whatever form your range
         weapon takes.  If you are using a bow, you will receive two shots
         each time you attack with it because of the speed of the weapon.
         Certain magical bows are rumored to fire even faster than two
         shots per attack.  Once you have used your ranged weapon attack,
         this counts as one of your attacks per phase.  If you have only
         one, then you had better keep backing up until the option
         reappears.  Note -- NO missile weapon is effective at point blank
         (adjacent) range.  You will waste your attack if you try this.
         All bow or sling weapons require projectiles.  If you run out of
         these, your ranged weapon becomes useless.  Keep a plentiful
         supply of these projectiles at all times.  All projectiles fired
         are considered unretrievable.

     (P) Plead for mercy:  This option allows you to beg and plead with
         your opponent to spare your life.  If, by some lucky chance, this
         happens, you will safely be allowed to leave the battle, although
         your opponent will probably take a portion of your gold as payment
         for his mercy.

     If you manage to reduce your opponent's health to zero or less, you
     will see a message proclaiming, "You have slain your opponent!"  To
     the victor goes the spoils, as the old saying goes.  You will see a
     message showing the score value of your opponent, how much gold you
     managed to scrounge off of his body, and how many levels, if any, you
     gained for defeating him.  If your opponent had better weaponry or
     armor than you, a message will appear afterwards showing the vital
     statistics of the weapon that you found.  Keep these statistics handy
     for range and comparative information.  Next you will be prompted by,
     "Trade this weapon for yours?"  Decide if you wish to trade it.  If
     you found anything else on your opponent, more equipment statistic
     screens will be displayed followed by more prompts asking if you would
     like to swap equipment.  Keep in mind that you can only hold one of
     each item (a melee weapon, range weapon, and armor).

     If, on the other hand, you lose the battle, a message will be
     displayed stating, "You have been killed!"  Do not despair,
     unfortunate friend, as the powerful Healer of the city will instantly
     attend to your mauled body and attempt to restore life back into your
     lifeless form.  If the resurrection is successful, you will be
     restored with ten percent of your maximum health back to you.  Further
     healing requires more gold.  You will notice that some of your gold is
     missing -- this is the cost to heal that ten percent required for a
     successful resurrection.  If your resurrection failed, your character
     is lost forever.  Failed resurrections are not very common, and sages
     have isolated the cause of these to two simple reasons.  Either one,
     you did not have enough money on hand to heal ten percent of your
     health, or two, the powerful magic of repeated resurrections has torn
     your body asunder.  Thankfully, resurrection magic vanishes from the
     body after a single day, therefore, the risk of repeated resurrections
     greatly lessens as each day passes.

     Be wary -- the Arena combat holds many surprises, as powerful monsters
     and heroes have special attacks which can paralyze, poison, level
     drain, petrify, and do even nastier things to your characters.
     Extreme caution is advised as the road to becoming a BladeMaster is a
     very difficult one to traverse, guarded by over two hundred unique
     guardians all thirsting for your blood.  It is also a road paved with
     magical spoils -- powerful, unique swords and radiant enchanted armor
     with special protections.  Will you achieve ultimate victory?  We, the
     game designers, wish you the best of luck as you strive to achieve
     immortality as one of celestial rank of . . .

THE MAJOR CD 
INSTALLATION AND USER MANUAL

Thank you for buying Major CD. You will soon find out that Major CD is the most
powerful CD-ROM manager for The Major BBS. Major CD was first released for
Major BBS version 5.3. Since that time it has changed a lot. The current
version of Major CD is has even become more powerful than we would ever thought
it would. However, we never could have done it on our own. Many of the powerful
options of Major CD are the result of the great feedback Major CD owners gave
us. We would like to thank all those wonderful sysops for their feedback and
positive input during the development of Major CD. We also thank those sysop
for their patience, because they had to setup Major CD almost without a manual
(this is our second attempt to write a good manual). As a way of say thanks to
our customers we have always supplied updates and upgrades of Major CD for free
(accept the separate LAN-option) and we would like to continue this policy as
long as we can hold.
We have tried to make the installation process of Major CD as easy as possible,
but it's still something you have to do easy, step by step. Remember that Major
CD can handle up to 255 CD-Roms so there are a lot of things to take care
about. Take your time to install Major CD and if you are not sure about any
option, CALL US!! 


BEFORE YOU INSTALL MAJOR CD

Before you install Major CD to your system there are three things you have to
take care of first:
1)	Be sure your BBS is running without ANY problems. If you are having 
	Catastro or GP errors of any kind you must fix that first. Don't install 
	Major CD on a system that doesn't run smooth. Major CD will support and 
	use almost every trick Galacticomm build in to The Major BBS (locks, keys, 
	pseudo_keys, textvars, statistics, user settings and so on) so it's 
	essentional your system works correctly.
2)	Install your hardware (CD-ROM players, controllers, network cards and so 
	on) first. After you add your CD-ROM players be sure you can copy files 
	from a CD to your hard drive, both offline and online (use the copy 
	command of the Remote Sysop Menu or the E-Mail File attachment (sysop 
	option F) to check it). If you are not able to copy files from the CD to 
	your hard drive using your BBS, Major CD will have the same problems. Like 
	The Major BBS will not run if your hard drive fails, Major CD will not 
	work correctly if your CD-ROM players do not function optimal.
3)	Make a backup of your system. We never do it ourself, but if you are 
	calling us telling you lost some files, prepare for the answer: "refer to 
	your backup".

PIONEER DRM60x CD-ROM DISKCHANGER

Major CD has special support for the Pioneer DRM60x MiniChanger. If you want to
offer your users a lot of files, we would suggest you take a look at those
drives. The Pioneer DRM60x drive is a CD-ROM player with a magazine of 6 disks.
It will load any of the six disks when a user (or Major CD) access it. At the
time of this writing the price for the DRM602 player is below $1000. During the
configuration of Major CD you will notice some special questions regarding the
Pioneer DRM60x player.
If you install your Pioneer DRM60x player right out of the box' the device
driver will assign a drive letter for each disk in the player. For example, if
the first disk is drive letter D: you can access the files on those CD by just
changing your MS-DOS prompt to that drive. If you type
		D:
		DIR
you will see a directory of the first CD. If you type
		E:
		DIR
the Pioneer player will load the second disk and you will see a directory of
that disk.
If you calculate the number of drive letters you can assign to a MS-DOS
computer, you'll notice it's limited to 26. Because A:, B: and C: are reserved
this will limit' the number of CD-ROM players to 23.
With the Pioneer DRM60x players this limit can be broken. Pioneer released the
DRD608.SYS device driver. This device driver will not assign a drive letter to
each disk of the DRM60x player but will only assign one drive letter to the
whole player. With a separate program (XDISK) you'll have to make a specific
disk active'. So to access the first disk of the Pioneer player you type
	XDISK D: 1
	D:
	DIR
and to access the second disk
	XDISK D: 2
	D:   (note the same drive letter)
	DIR

Because you can attach seven SCSI devices (Pioneer players) to one SCSI
controller, you can have up to 42 disks online using only seven drive letters
(one for each player).
We can't include the DRD608.SYS device driver because it is copyrighted by
Pioneer, but you can download it from our support system or directly from the
BBS of Pioneer. You will not find any configuration option of Major CD
regarding this device driver, because Major CD will automaticly use this device
driver if it's there.
Remember again: be sure that you have your CD-ROM player(s) working before
you install Major CD. It's essentional that you try to copy some files online
from the CD-ROM to your hard drive. If that works Major CD can work with it
also.


INSTALLING MAJOR CD

Before you install or update Major CD you should read the UPDATE.TXT file. This
file contains information on the changes we have made after writing this
manual. Remember: Any instruction in the update.Txt file will overrule the
instructions in this manual!

There are several ways to install Major CD. First of all: if you received Major
CD on a disk, put that disk in a drive and type A:INSTALL'  (or B:INSTALL'
for the other drive). The installation program will ask you some questions.
Nothing tricky about that, just answer them by your best knowledge. You'll have
a change to change them later.

The seconde way to install Major CD is a little more complicated. But if you
follow this instructions step by step it's not that hard.

- Create a subdirectory called MAJORCD on any hard drive of your system (we use  
  C:\MAJORCD in this example)
- Copy the files of Major CD to this directory
- Be sure PKUNZIP is in your path or in the MAJORCD directory
- Change your prompt to the MAJORCD directory by typing
	C:
	CD \MAJORCD
- Decompress the files with "PKUNZIP *.ZIP"
- Delete the original ZIP files with "DEL *.ZIP"
- Type "COPY *.VIR *.DAT"
- Copy the Major CD Btrieve files to any place you want to keep them. You don't 
  have to use your BBS directory if you don't like, but we are assuming you do. 
  So type "COPY *.DAT C:\BBSV6"
- Write down the path for those Btrieve files!
- Now delete those Btrieve files from the installation directory 
  with "DEL *.DAT"
- Create a directory to store the menufiles of the CD-ROM disks (we will discus 
  that later).
- Write down the path of the directory you just created
- Create a directory where Major CD will copy the files from the CD-ROM disks 
  to. If you're running your system from a network, be sure this directory is 
  on the server.

  To gain maximum speed and to handle CD-Disk changers like the Pioneer DRM60x 
  player, your users will not download the files from the CD directly. This 
  would slow down your system dramaticly. Instead, Major CD copies the files 
  from your CD's to a place on your hard drive. This retrieving' happens fully 
  in the background, so you won't notice any slowdown. During system-up and the 
  nightly cleanup Major CD will wipe-out all the files from this directory. 
  DON'T USE THIS DIRECTORY FOR ANYTHING ELSE!!
- Write down the path of the swap' directory you just created.
- Copy all the files that are left in the installation directory to your BBS 
  directory with "COPY *.* C:\BBSV6"
- Delete all the files from your installation directory with "DEL *.*"
- You can now delete the installation directory if you like.
- Now it's time to fire up the Major BBS configuration editor
- Type "CD \BBSV6"
- Type BBS
- It could take a while until your system accepts commands after you typed BBS. 
  Don't worry, just wait.
- After a while you'll see the Major BBS Main configuration screen. Now it's 
  time to configure Major CD step by step. We will discus every possible option 
  of the setup. However, some options are related to other options and will not 
  show up if you don't need them. So don't worry if we discus an option you 
  can't find. You probably won't need it.

USE THE FOLLOWING METHOD IF YOU ARE UPDATING MAJOR CD!!
- Be sure to make an backup of all your MR_*.* files. 
- Check the Major CD configuration and write your settings down.
- Create a subdirectory called MAJORCD on any hard drive of your system (we use 
  C:\MAJORCD in this example)
- Copy the files of Major CD to this directory
- Be sure PKUNZIP is in your path or in the MAJORCD directory
- Change your prompt to the MAJORCD directory by typing
	C:
	CD \MAJORCD
- Decompress the files with "PKUNZIP *.ZIP"
- Delete the original ZIP files with "DEL *.ZIP"
- Delete the compiled message file with "DEL C:\BBSV6\MR_MJRCD.MCV" (assuming 
  C:\BBSV6 is your BBS directory)
- Delete the Btrieve files from the installation directory with "DEL *.DAT"
- Copy the files to update by typing the following commands:
	COPY *.DLL C:\BBSV6
	COPY *.EXE C:\BBSV6
	COPY *.MSG C:\BBSV6
	COPY *.DOC C:\BBSV6
	COPY *.TXT C:\BBSV6
	COPY *.VIR C:\BBSV6
	COPY *.MDF C:\BBSV6
- Delete all the files from your installation directory with "DEL *.*"
- You can now delete the installation directory if you like.
- Now it's time to fire up the Major BBS configuration editor
- Type "CD \BBSV6"
- Type BBS
- It could take a while until your system accepts commands after you typed BBS. 
  Don't worry, just wait.


HARDWARE SETUP

Hit F1 from the Major BBS startup screen to enter the Hardware Setup. When the
configuration screen appears hit the F8 key and type "MR_MJRCD" (without the
quotes). After a while the configuration editor will present you the first
Major CD option. We will discus all the options here. Some of them are related
to other options:

CDLAN:	Are ALL your CD-ROM players on workstations (Yes/No)
If you have the Major CD LAN-option, you could answer YES to this question
(refer to the manual of the Major CD LAN-option). If you don't have the Major
CD LAN-option, answer No to this question.
[start commercial]
If you run your system on any kind of network, you should take a look at the
Major CD LAN-option. With this Major CD add-on you can put all your CD-ROM
player on different workstations. When a user request some files Major CD send
out this request on the network. The workstation will retrieve the files to the
server without effecting the speed of your system. This means your BBS is
running at full speed and ALSO retrieving the files is at full speed.If you do
not run your system on a network, you should really consider it. The speed
increase is enormous and it's easy to maintain (and you need the Major CD LAN-
option -:))
[end of commercial]

PIOCON:	Are you using a Pioneer DRM minichanger (Yes/No)
Major CD has some special code to handle the Pioneer DRM60x minichanger (please
read the introduction in this manual about it).

Answer NO to this question if:
- you don't have a Pioneer DRM60x player
- you have a Pioneer player but also another player(s)

SCSIADD: Address of SCSI controller (C800/CA00/CE00/DE00/NONE)
If you connected your Pioneer player to a 8-bit Future Domain controller, you
can activate the special routines Major CD has build in for this type of
controller. The Future Domain controller has four possible base addresses you
can select with dipswitches or jumpers (please read your Future Domain manual
for the correct address). 
If you answered YES to the option PIOCON but you don't have an 8-bit Future
Domain controller, select "NONE" here. This way you'll activate some other
Pioneer routines.
You will not see this option if you didn't select the Pioneer drive.

SCSINUM: Unit number of the Pioneer drive (0-7)
If you connect a Pioneer DRM60x player to your system and you are using it with
the Future Domain SCSI controller, Major CD has to know the unit number of the
first (or only) Pioneer player. We suggest that you use the default settings of
zero but if you prefer another unit number, you can change it here. If you use
multiple Pioneer players, Major CD expects the unit numbers in a row. So if
your first player has unit number 0 the second must have unit number 1, the
third unit number 2 and so on.
If you don't have the 8-bit Future Domain controller, this option has no
effect.

CDDRV: First drive letter of CD-ROM drive (C-Z)
To access the CD-ROM players Major CD has to know their drive letters. You can
enter the drive letter of the first CD-ROM player here. If you use multiple
drives or the Pioneer DRM60x player, you must be sure the drive letters follow
each other. So if you can access your first drive with drive letter L: the next
player MUST be drive letter M:.

NUMTHER: How many disks are you using (1-255)
Major CD can handle up to 255 CD-ROM disks for you (if you own the LAN-option).
On a standard setup the number of disks is limited by the alphabet (number of
drive letters). Normally this means you can attach 23 CD-ROM disks/players to
your system (drive letters D-Z). However, if you are using Pioneer DRM60x
players, you should take a look at the DRD608.SYS device driver (you can
download it from our support systems). This device driver only uses one drive
letter for a complete six pack'. If you use the DRD608.SYS device driver you
can attach up to seven Pioneer DRM60x player (42 disks) and only use seven
drive letters. You don't have to change anything to Major CD, if you install
the DRD608.SYS device driver, Major CD will know it (and use it). The number of
disks you'll have to enter here doesn't have to be the same as the number of
players. For example if you connect three Pioneer DRM60x players to your
system, the number of disks is 18 and not three.

This was the last hardware configure' option of Major CD. Press F10 to save
your setup.

SECURITY & ACCOUNTING

Hit F3 from the Major BBS startup screen to enter the Security & Accounting
Setup. When the configuration screen appears hit the F8 key and type "MR_MJRCD"
(without the quotes). After a while the configuration editor will present you
the first Major CD option. There is only one option here:

ABRTDWN: Charge aborted downloads (Yes/No)
Sometimes a user doesn't complete his download. If you want to charge him for
the file anyhow, answer Yes to this question.

Press F10 to save your setup.


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

It's now time enter the configuration option. Hit F4 from the Major BBS startup
screen to enter the Configuration Options. When the configuration screen
appears hit the F8 key and type "MR_MJRCD" (without the quotes). After a while
the configuration editor will present you the first Major CD option. We will
discus all the options here. Some of them are related to other options but we
will discus them all.

CDCODE: Major-CD Personal code
Major CD needs an activation code before it will work. This is just a friendly
copy protection we use. The activation code you did receive is related to your
system. Please carve this number in your desk (or store it on a place were you
can find it). Without the activation code Major CD is useless. If you don't
have an activation code yet, please give us a call (get your BBS registration
number first).

CDPLUS: Enable full screen ANSI-tagger (Yes/No)
Major CD uses a very powerful way for your users to browse through your CD's
and tag the files they want to download. Using a lot of ANSI codes Major CD
gives the users the option to use page-up, page-down, scroll-up, scroll-down
and so on. Because Major CD uses a lot of ANSI code, it's essentional that the
user terminal-program fully supports ANSI. Some Amiga- or Atari-Programs don't
have a full implementation of ANSI. Those users can't use the Full ANSI-tagger.
If your users are using Qmodem, let them switch to VT100 instead of ANSI (The
VT100 emulation of Qmodem is more ANSI compatible than the ANSI emulation). If
you get a lot of questions from your users, you could decide to remove the
ANSI-tagger completely. To do so, answer NO to this question.
(Every user can enter his personal preferences (ANSI-tagger on/off) that is
saved to disk).

CDSWAP: Path name to copy files to
To let your system run at maximum speed (and to support diskchangers), Major CD
does not allow a user to download directly from a CD-ROM. The slowest part of a
CD-ROM player is seeking to a file. So if two (or more) users would download
from the same CD-ROM the player has to seek constantly between one file and
another. This would slowdown your system to crawling speed. That's why Major CD
handles things a little different. The users can browse through your database
without accessing the CD-ROM drive at all, because all the descriptions are
stored in Btrieve files. The moment the user tags a file for download Major CD
sends out a file request. This file request is picked up by a background
routine (or a workstation program if you own the Major CD LAN-option). This
routine will copy the file(s) from the CD to a temporary place on your hard
drive. The moment the file is copied (we call it retrieved) the user is
notified. The background task only copies one file at a time so there's no seek
problem. With this option you tell Major CD were to store those files. To be
sure Major CD doesn't fill up your hard drive the files are automaticly deleted
when a user has downloaded them or logs of. At the nightly cleanup, system-up
and system-down Major CD will delete ALL the files in this swap directory'. So
don't use this directory for something else. If you want to loose information
this directory is a good place to store it. Again: Major CD will delete every
file in this directory!!

CDPATH: Path for Btrieve files
Although Galacticomm thinks every sysop uses a gigabyte hard drive as one C-
partition to store his complete BBS on, we are not sure about that. A lot of
systems just start with a 120 Mb hard drive, add another, change one of them to
a 240 Mb and grow little by little. Galacticomm doesn't give you the option to
store your Btrieve files on a place you want (or need). To avoid you have to
buy another hard drive, Major CD gives you the option to store the Btrieve
files on a place YOU WANT. Just enter the full path where you want to keep the
Btrieve files for Major CD (you need about 1.5 Mb of workspace for every CD).
Don't end the path with a backslash (not even if you use the root of a drive),
so use D: not D:\ (D:\CD not D:\CD\). If you decide to use your BBS directory,
just enter the pathname (like C:\BBSV6).
(BTW: If you agree with us Galacticomm should make it optional to store the
files where YOU want, please TELL THEM!!).

RTBLK: Enter the retrieve block bytes
The background task of Major CD retrieves a file block by block. This means
that it copies one piece of a file from CD to your hard drive and gives the
control back to your system. When your system has served the users the
background task will copy another block. You must balance the computerpower
between the background task and your system. You do this with two options (this
one and the next). If you raise the block size of the retrieve buffer it will
copy the files faster and will slowdown your system more. The size of the
retrieve buffer is different for every system, it depends on your computer,
number of lines, CD-ROM player, kind of controller and so on. It's almost
impossible to give you some advice here, but if we must: start with a retrieve
buffer of 512 bytes. First tune' the next option before you change this.

CPYSPEED: Speed of file retrieval (1-5000)
As we just told you the background task of Major CD will retrieve the file from
the CD-ROM to your hard drive block by block. The background task is hooked'
to the system load (number of lines in use). This means our background task is
called many times (hundreds) each second. With this option you can define how
many BBS-cycles the background task can use before giving control back to your
system. If you want to tune' your system start with this option. If you lower
the number the copy process will slow down and the system load' is less. If
you raise this number the files are retrieved faster but there is more system
load'.

DOZIP: Insert a new ZIP-comment to ZIP-files (Yes/No)
On many CD-ROM disks the files are compressed using PKZIP. The so-called ZIP-
files can contain ZIP-comments. This comment is shown to the user when he/she
UNZIPs the file. Most of the ZIP-files stored on CD-ROM already have a ZIP-
comment with a little commercial of the CD-Publisher or the system where the
publisher got his files from. If you answer YES to this question, Major CD will
insert your own ZIP-comment (commercial) overwriting any existing comment. You
can find the ZIP-comment Major CD uses as a textblock in configuration 6. Major
CD has a lot real time textvariables you can use with that ZIP-comment. We'll
discus that later. If you don't want to insert your own ZIP-comment, answer NO
to this question.

COMMENT: Comment inserted in ZIP files
This is the actual ZIP-comment. Hit F2 to change it. Please read the chapter
about Text-variables. There are some special text-vars for use in this ZIP-
comment and there are some you may not use here.

LSTSTOP: Stop List Function at the end of (LIB/CD/NEVER)
Major CD uses two locks for every CD. If an user has the first key he can see
the CD-ROM, but he needs the second key to download from it. If you use
different locks and keys for different CD's you must prevent a user sneaking in
to the wrong CD. When a user asks for a file list of a CD and the end of the
selected Library is reached, the list function can continue with the next
Library. If the list functions reaches the end of a CD it can go on with the
next CD. Although it will prevent a user from downloading from a CD it has no
key for it, it doesn't prevent him from seeing it (if you allow to show the
next CD). With this option you can define where the list function(s) should
stop: at the end of a Library, the end of a CD or never.
BTW: If you want to put adult files online, you should read the chapter about
pseudo-keys.

CDSHOC: Register Major CD downloads in Auditrail (Yes/No)
When a user finishes or aborts a download of a file of one of your CD's, Major
CD can show this in your auditrail. This will help you to see what's happening.
However if every download is reported in your auditrail, this file will rapidly
grow (did you know of the Auditrail purge function of Major STAT. This option
will delete all auditrail entries after a specified number of days.) Answer YES
if you want to see the downloads in your auditrail, or NO if you want to
prevent it.

CDGLOB: Global command to show taglist (/Show)
When an user tags a file from your CD-ROM list, that file is added to his Major
BBS taglist. However, the file is not available for download yet because the
background task has to retrieve it first. If an user looks at his taglist the
files he/she has tagged from the CD's are there. If the file is ready for
download it will show up as Retrieved'. If the file is not ready yet, the user
will see Qued' after the filename. Because retrieving the files happens in the
background the user doesn't have to wait for it. He/she can leave Major CD and
use some other services you provide. The moment a file is retrieved the user
will be notified. The user can look at his taglist anywhere on your system by
using the global command here. If you change it to something else, you must
also change the user-manual.

MNUPATH: Path of the menu-files
Major CD doesn't stores the menu-files of your CD's in the message-file.
Instead it will read them from your hard drive. This way you can use any kind
of editor to change them. The filename you should use is MR_CDn (where n is the
CD-number, so MR_CD1 for the first disk MR_CD255 for the last disk Major CD can
handle). The extension you use for the menus is fully compatible with The Major
BBS. With the standard edition you can use .IBM for IBM-Ansi users, .ANS for
non-IBM Ansi users, .ASC for non-Ansi users and .RIP for RIP users. So to
services the three kind of different users, you must have three different menu-
files. For the first CD this will be:
MR_CD1.IBM, MR_CD1.ANS, MR_CD1.ASC and MR_CD1.RIP
If you add additional languages to your system (German, France, Greek) you can
use the extensions you entered when you add that language. With this option you
define the path to your menu-files. 

GENMAIN: Generate MAIN-menu (Yes/No)
Major CD can construct the Main-CD-menu for you. This is the menu where the
user has to select the CD of his choice. When Major CD generates this menu it
will check the users key. If an user doesn't have access at all to a CD, he
will never see it.
If you want to have nice artwork (or different languages), you can ask Major CD
NOT to generate the main-menu. If you answer NO to this question Major CD will
not generate the main-menu but load it from your hard drive. The file name you
must use for this is MR_MAIN. It uses the same extensions as we described
above.

TEXT BLOCKS

All the messages send to the users are defined in option 6 of the Major BBS
configuration editor. Just hit F6 from the BBS menu. When the editor shows up
type F8 followed by MR_MJRCD. After some time the editor will present you the
first textblock of Major CD.
Major CD uses a lot of so-called textvariables. Please read the Major BBS
manual about how to use those textvariables and how to insert them into your
textblocks. Although Major CD stores most of the CD-menus on your hard drive we
added some code so you can use the textvariables in those menus to. Just edit
those menus with BBSDRAW and refer to the Major BBS manual to see how you can
use the textvariables. There are three kinds of textvariables within Major CD:
System wide, Major CD only and Qued'. You can use the System Wide'
textvariables anywhere on your system. For example you can add the textvariable
CDFILES to the main menu of your file library telling your users how many files
are on CD. The Major CD only' textvariables can only be used within Major CD
itself. Don't use them outside of Major CD. That will give some strange results
and can possible cause your system to GP. The Qued' textvariables can only be
used within the ZIP-comment of Major CD.

TEXTVAR	KIND			Description

MAJOR CD OFFLINE UTILITIES

Most of the configuration of Major CD is done using an add-on program. You can
start The Major CD Utility section' by hitting the F8 key (Add-on Utilities)
from the Major BBS menu. When the popup menu appears select MR_CDUTL Major CD
Add-on Utility'.
Note: You can only start this utility if you configured Major CD as
described above. So first setup those options first! You must also
copy (or move) the Major CD Btrieve files to the directory you
specified in Level-4 configuration. Just go to your BBSV6 directory
and type "COPY MR_*.DAT MYPATH". (where MYPATH is the directory
you've entered in the level-4 configuration).
The Major CD Utility section is used to maintain your CD-ROM's. We will
describe the different options step by step. Remember: you can always cancel
any option by hitting the ESCape key.


CD-Config: Configure your CD-ROM setup
With this option you'll describe your different CD-ROM's. Move the selectionbar
to this option using the cursor keys and hit enter. The next thing you'll see
is a list of all possible CD's Major CD can handle. Again you can use the
cursor keys to select any of the CD's. Lets start with the first one: Position
the selectionbar on the line starting with 001' and hit the enter key. The
next thing you'll see is a dialogbox describing your first CD (possible empty
right now). There are three commands here, the active command is show in the
last line. Hit the spacebar to cycle through the commands. If you select
Cancel'  (and hit the return key) you will return to the utility section. With
Delete' you will wipe out the complete information of the selected CD, without
asking any questions. Select Edit' (and hit the Return key) if you want to
describe a CD. The first thing you'll have to provide is the string an user has
to enter to select this CD. This string can be from one single character to
three characters (you need it if you connect more then 100 CD's to your system)
but must NOT begin with a X. Hit the Return key if you entered this selection
string.
The next option is the description of the CD. Major CD uses this to generate
the Main CD menu (if you selected that).
Now it's time to charge the users. There are two ways you can charge your users
if they download files from your CD's. The first File charge' is the amount of
credits Major CD charges for every file downloaded from this CD. The second
Kilobyte Charge' is the number of credits you want to charge a user for every
Kb he/she downloads from this CD. If you don't want to charge your users, just
enter 0 (zero) for both charges.
Every CD uses two different keys. If an user has the Visible key' he can see
the CD and browse through the file descriptions. However he/she can't download
files from the CD. To download a file from a CD (tag it first) the user must
have the tag' key. Remember if you give an user the tag' key you must also
give him/her the visible' key.
After entering the Tag key' CD-config stores the information and brings you
back to the list of CD's so you can describe the next CD.
Hit ESCape to return to the main menu of the utility section.
PSEUDO_KEYS: Major CD uses a special Pseudo_key which you can use to lock out
an user or give him access. You can use the pseudo_key anyware on your system.
A pseudo_key is a little different from the normal keys Major BBS uses because
it's not added to the users keyring. Instead it's calculated everytime it
referenced to. The second difference is that pseudo_keys give you more
interaction'. The pseudo_key Major CD ads to your system is _CDAGE#'. If you
use this key you have to add a number to it. An user has the _CDAGE#' key if
he reached a specific age. For example: if you have adult CD's and you don't
want users under the age of 18 to even see them, you can use the pseudo_key
_CDAGE#18'. The moment a users age is 18 the system will give him this key.
You can also use _CDAGE#12' to lock out everybody younger than 12 years. The
_CDAGE# pseudo key is not limited to Major CD. You can use it anywhere on your
system.
 
CD-Copy: Copy pre-generated Btrieve files to Major CD
Major CD stores all the information of your CD's in Btrieve files. The reason
for this is obvious: speed. Before you can give your users access to Major CD
you'll have to login' your disk(s). There are several ways to do this; we will
discus the most easy way first: CD-Copy.
Creating a Btrieve file for a CD-ROM requires some work for you. Remember Major
CD has to know the filenames, sizes, descriptions and paths of every file on
the disk. We will discus later how to create a script file to login a disk.
However, most of the time there's a more easy way. Before you want to add a CD
to your system, call one of our support systems. Go to the File Library and
check for a Major CD library. You will find a number of pre-generated Btrieve
files there (thanks to all contributing sysops). Download the pre-generated
Btrieve files to your hard drive. Create a temporary directory and UNZIP the
file. Every ZIP has at least three files: one with the extension PAT, one with
the extension FIL and one menufile. Use the commandline (stand-alone) version
of the CDCheck program (discusses later) to check the Btrieve files. Don't skip
this part: many CD's are updated regular without changing the name (ex. Simtel
and Garbo).
After you compared the Btrieve files with the CD itself (with CDCheck) start
the Major CD Utility section and fire up CD-Copy. You will be asked to enter
the full pathname of the pre-generated Btrieve files (without extension.
example "D:\MAJORCD\BTRIEVE\GARBO"). CD-Copy will notify you if it can't find
the files. If it has located the files it will ask you the CD-number. This
number must match the CD-number you have used in CD-Config. If you didn't use
that number before (already logged in a CD with that number) CD-Copy will copy
the records from the pre-generated Btrieve files to your master list
(MR_CDPAT.DAT and MR_CDFIL.DAT). On the screen you will see what CD-Copy is
doing. If all the records are copied, you will return to the main menu of the
utility section. Hit ESCape several times to return to the DOS prompt.
Now use the menu-file (that comes with the pre-generated Btrieve files) as a
starting point to create your own. Remember the filename and extension
conventions (MR_CDx.IBM, MR_CDx.ANS, MR_CDx.ASC, MR_CDx.RIP and whatever
extension you defined with an added language). If you created the menu-files
(if you use BBSDRAW from Galacticomm you can use all the textvariables
(discussed later) to), copy them to the directory you specified during the
configuration setup' (path for Major CD menu files). You may also want to
change the MR_MAIN.* files.
Now you are all set and ready to fire up your system.

CD-Login: Login a complete CD using a script file
If you can't find the pre-generated Btrieve files for the disk(s) you want to
put online, you'll have to create them yourself. It takes some time but it's
not that difficult. The best thing to do is to find some master list of your
CD. Most CD's have some files with the complete description of the CD (often
FILES.BBS, ALLFILES.LST, TOTAL.ASC or something like that). Starting with such
a file you'll have to convert it to Major CD standard'.
Every CD has several directories. With Major CD you can attach several
directories to one library. So if your CD has subdirectories for printer
drivers for windows, screen drivers for windows and icons for windows you can
put them together in a library called Misc stuff for Windows'. The best thing
to do, before you create the Major CD script file is to paint' the menu files
for that CD. This way you know which directories you want to join and which
library number you will give them. Please use the correct extensions (IBM, ANS,
ASC, RIP and so on).
The master list that describes your CD must be divided into the different
paths. Although Major CD can join paths for you, it must know where to search
for a file. A script file for Major CD is divided in several parts. Each part
describes the files for ONE subdirectory and MUST start with the following
line:

(MR_CDDIR)  11  D:\WINDOWS\PRINTERS

The first part is a kind of a signature for CD-Login to know a directory
description follows. After (MR_CDDIR) there are at least two spaces followed by
a number. This is the Library number you want to use for this CD-directory. If
you want to join directories, just give them the same library number. After the
number there are again at least two spaces followed by the path to the files
(don't end this with a backslash, not even for a root directory). 
After the path-description-line' we just discussed comes the descriptions of
the files in that specific directory. Each file description has to be in the
following format:

EXAMPLE.ZIP  63267  Example how to build a nuclear modem accelerator

The first part of the line is the file name. This is followed by TWO spaces.
The next part is the size of the file WITHOUT any dots or commas (so 63267 and
NOT 63,267). After the file size there are again TWO spaces followed by the
description of the file. Major CD (and CD-Login) only uses 60 characters for
the file description. Everything more is cut off.
This way you can describe all the file in one directory. After the file-description-
lines comes the next (MR_CDDIR)' line followed by the file descriptions of the
next directory.
Note: CD-Login ignores a line that starts with a space. So if you'll have a
master list of files where some files have multiple line descriptions, you
don't have to delete the extra lines as long as those lines are starting with
some spaces.

If you described every file on the CD as mentioned above it's time to fire up
the Major CD Utility section again (remember the full pathname of your script
file). When the main menu of the utility section appears, select CD-Login. CD-
Login will ask you the full pathname of your scriptfile. In the next question
CD-Login will ask you the full pathname of the Btrieve files it has to generate
(don't enter an extension). The next thing you'll see is CD-Login creating your
Btrieve files. It will show its progress on the screen. For your reference it
will pause for about two second everytime it finds a new path in your script
file.

When all work is done, CD-Copy created two files for you: one with the
extension PAT and the other with the extension FIL. Use the command line
version of CDCHECK to check those Btrieve files against the CD itself.

If there are no errors in the Btrieve files there are two things to do. You can
now add the descriptions to your master files using CD-Copy as described above.
The next thing to do is to ZIP the two Btrieve files (the ones you just created
(PAT and FIL)) and the menu files for it and upload it to one of our support
systems. Other sysops will be very thankful for your contribution.

CD-List: Generate a Master list of a CD
Many users don't like to search for files online so they would like to download
a complete list of files on your CD-ROM's (read the section about Quicktag
(tm)). With the CD-List option of the utility section you can create such a
master list (of every CD). Just select the option, enter the full pathname of
the file you want to create and the number of the CD you want CD-List to create
a master list for.

CD-Extract: Make a separate Btrieve file for a CD
With this option you can extract all the records for one particular CD form
your system and generate stand alone Btrieve files (the files used by CD-Copy).
After you selected this option you'll have to enter the full pathname of the
files you want to generate (no extension) and the number of the CD you want
stand alone Btrieve files from.

CD-Delete: Delete a complete CD from the Btrieve files
If you want to remove a CD from your system, for example to update it. You can
use CD-Delete to delete every record for a specific CD. Just enter the number
of the CD and answer yes to the question "are you sure". CD-Delete will delete
every file and path reference of that CD. We suggest that you use CD-Extract
first in case you need the CD again.

CD-Browse: Browse through the Btrieve file
With this option of the Major CD utility section you can walk' through the
files you already logged into your system. After you entered the CD number CD-
Browse shows you a screen full of files. Just use the cursor keys, page-up,
page-down, home and end key to walk' through the files. If you want to make
little modifications to a file you can hit the Return key. CD-Browse will popup
a screen with the information of that selected file. You can change the file
name, CD number, Library number, file size and description. Hit ESCape to
cancel this option.

CD-Dupe: Search MBBS File Library for Dupes on CD-ROM
When you have a big file library and just add a CD-ROM to your system it's
possible that you have some files on your hard drive that are also on your CD-
ROM. To avoid spilling room on your hard drive the Major CD utility section has
this option. CD-Dupe will check the file names in your File Library with the
file names on CD (don't worry, it's lightning fast). CD-Dupe will NOT delete
anything!!
When you select CD-Dupe it will ask you for the name of a logfile it will
create. Right after you answered that it will compare the File Library with
your CD's. After some seconds your hard drive stops spinning (CD-Dupe is
ready). Hit ESCape to go back to the main menu of the utility section. If you
look at the file CD-Dupe created for you, you will see the files that are both
on one of your CD's and in your File Library. CD-Dupe added the sizes and
descriptions of both entries. It's up to you to decide what you do with this
information.

CD-Check: Compares the Btrieve files with the CD itself
If you are not sure the records for a particular CD are in sync' with your CD,
you can use this option. CD-Check will compare the records for one CD with the
CD itself. Remember this option could take more then a hour. Select CD-Check
and enter the number of the CD you want to check. CD-Check will look if all the
files you have logged in are accessible by Major CD. It also checks to see if
all the files on your CD are logged in. When CD-Check is finished it has
created a file called CD_CHECK.LOG. In this file you can read the files that
are logged in but can not be found on the CD and the files CD-Check found on
your CD that are not logged in. The log-file of CD-Check will end with a list
of all the paths used for the selected CD.
We suggest that you use the stand alone version of CD-Check to check the pre-
generated Btrieve files before you copy them to your master list (with CD-
Copy).  
You can't use CD-Check from the utility section if your CD-players are
connected to another computer (The LAN-version of Major CD). In that case you
should use:
CD-Check Offline:
The stand alone version of CD-Check will not compare the CD's already logged in
to your system. CD-Check compares pre-generated Btrieve files (generated with
CD-Login) with the disk. To check pre-generated files, copy those files
(extension PAT and FIL) to a subdirectory together with CDCHECK.EXE and
BTRIEVE.EXE. Be sure the CD-ROM disk is in the drive.
Now first start Btrieve with "Btrieve /P:2048 /E".
To check a CD type "CDCHECK CDNAME CDDRIVE"
CDNAME is the filename of the pre-generated Btrieve files (without extension)
and CDDRIVE is the drive letter of the CD. To check the Garbo CD while the CD
player can be reached on the E drive you should type: "CDCHECK
C:\MAJORCD\MYOWNDIR\GARBO  E:"
CD-Check will create a log file telling you which files are recorded in the
Btrieve files but not on CD and the files that are on the CD but not in the
Btrieve files.

CD-Offline: Generate index file for offline programs
Major CD has some special support for Quicktag (tm). With quicktag your users
can search, browse and select files offline. The offline Quicktag programs will
generate a little request file the user can upload right into Major CD. Please
read the special chapter about Quicktag (tm).


MAJOR CD STATISTICS

Major CD generates a lot of statistics. This will help you to determine which
CD-ROM's are the most popular and which libraries on the CD's are the most
popular. First of all: Major CD is Major STATS aware'. The moment you'll add
Major STAT (a $75 statistics module) to your system, Major CD will generate
three general statistic screens and one popularity screen for EVERY CD. To see
the realtime statistics of Major CD, just hit ALT-T on your BBS console. You
will see a list of statistics generated by the Major BBS itself and some by
other TPD modules. Use the cursor keys to move to the Major CD screens. The
first screen you see (MajorCD Daily) gives you an overview of the files
downloaded today. This screen shows the twelf most popular CD's today from top
to bottom. The most popular CD has always a full bar showing. In the lower
right corner of the screen you will see how many files are downloaded from this
CD. The other bars are related to this number. Note: This number doesn't give
you the total number of downloads today, it will only give you the number of
downloads of the most popular CD (the one at the top).
If you hit the cursor down key you will see the most popular CD of this month.
It has the same layout as the daily stat, so the number at the lower right
corner gives you the number of downloads from the most popular CD, shown at the
top of the statistic screen.
Another cursor down gives you the yearly statistics.

The Major CD Library statistics (another cursor down) will show you the most
popular libraries of a CD. The most popular library is shown at the top with a
full bar. All other libraries are reflected to this one. The number at the
lower right corner gives you the number of downloads from the most popular
library (not the total number of downloads, you can show them online using the
textvariables).
If you have more then one CD-ROM online you can see the library statistics of
the other CD's by using the Page-up and Page-down key.


QUICKTAG
Major CD now supports Quicktag. Quicktag is a file request protocol defined by
some Dutch programmers. If your users want to use Quicktag, you must create the
Quicktag database files of the CD(s) you have online. Go to the Major CD
utility section and select CD-Offline. This option will first ask you for the
number of the CD you want to create index files for, followed by the file name.
We suggest you use the predefined file names, because that is what the Quicktag
programs are looking for. The Major CD Utility will create two files: a
description file (QTAGxx.DAT) and an index file (QTAGxx.IND). Both are used by
Quicktag.
Quicktag needs a third file (QTAGxx.MNU) to work correctly. You'll have to
create that file by hand.
QTAGxx.MNU consists of Return-terminated lines. The first line describes the
name of the CD, the second the number of the CD and the third the
selectionstring (max. 3 characters) on the BBS.
The rest of the file contains lines describing the different libraries of the
CD. NOTE!! It *IS* possible that a specific library number does not exists,
just because you wanted to start a menu on an even number. In that case the
line is blank.
So, in order to support Quicktag on your system you'll need to create three
files for every CD. Two of them are created by the Major CD Utility section,
the third you'll have to create yourself.
Remember: although Major CD fully supports Quicktag, the offline programs are
NOT part of Major CD. The next section describes the Quicktag file format in
detail. The description is send to the public so everybody can write his own
Quicktag program.


TECHNICAL DETAILS ABOUT QUICKTAG(tm)
Quicktag (tm) was developed by users of the Dutch STER BBS and adapted by the
programmer of Major CD. Although Major CD does support Quicktag, the offline
programs are copyright by the individual developers. However, due the
cooperation of all those Dutch programmers all Quicktag offline programs are
compatible. The offline programs are NOT part of Major CD but are distributed
as shareware.

Here is some information you'll need to build your own Quicktag program.

A complete description of a CD-ROM disk contains three files:
QTAGxx.MNU   Consists of Return-terminated lines. The first line describes
the name of the CD, the second the number of the CD and the third the
selectionstring (max. 3 characters) on the BBS.
The rest of the file contains lines describing the different libraries of the
CD.
NOTE!! It *IS* possible that a specific library number does not exists, just
because the sysop wants to starts his menus on an even number. In that case the
line is blank.

QTAGxx.DAT	A file with fixed-length records describing the files on the
CD. Here is the layout of each record:

		     struct ol {
			char tagged;
			char fname[13];
			long fsize;
			char descr[50];
		     } ol;

There are two 'special' records. The first record of a file to check the CD.
The field 'fname' of the first record contains the word  "*CDROM" (without
quotes). To be sure all files have to correct name the field 'fsize' of this
first record contains the number of the CD. 'tagged' and 'descr' or not used in
this first record.

Another record with a special meaning contains "*CDDIR" in the 'fname' field.
This record is the start of another library. The library number can be found in
the 'fsize' field.

For the rest of the records 'fname', 'fsize' and 'descr' are describing a file
on CD. The field 'tagged' is for your own personal use and can be used to
record which files a user already tagged in the past.


QTAGxx.IND		A index file containing the following records:

		     struct position {
			char libnum;
			long place;
		     } position;

'libnum' is the number of the library and 'place' is a seekpointer to the start
of the file descriptions of that library in the QTAGxx.DAT file. You can use
this file to quickly jump to a specific library.
NOTE!! There's no record order defined here. So the third record could contain
the seekpointer to library ten. Don't use the record number as a reference, use
'libnum' instead!


QUICKTAG.REQ	This is the little request file generated by the Quicktag
offline program (yours). It describes the files a user wants to download. A
QUICKTAG.REQ file starts with the following record:

		     struct qt {
			char signature[10];
			char key[128];
			char no_files;
		     } qt;

The 'signature' contains the word "QUICKTAG" (without quotes) followed by NULL
characters. 'key' is an copy if the 'key' field of the registration key file.
Just copy those bytes!
'no_files' contains the number of files a user requested. Remember: There's NO
WAY the offline program can tell how much files a user can tag on his BBS. Even
if the sysop allows him to tag 50 files, it is possible that the user already
tagged 20 files before uploading his request-list. Major CD will accept the
request-list and accepts as much files as possible.

The rest of the QUICKTAG.REQ contains records describing the files a user wants
to download and consists of 'no_files' times the following records:

		    struct tf {
			   char tag_cd;
			   char tag_lib;
			   char tagname[12];
		    } tf;


If an user registered his Quicktag program, he will get a little registration
key file: QUICKTAG.KEY
This file is 168 bytes in size and has the following structure:

	struct registration_key {
		char signature[10];
		char key[128];
		char username[30];
		}reg_key;

The first two fields are exactly the same as the 'qt structure'. First you
should check the signature to make sure it's a Quicktag file. After that: just
copy the first 138 bytes over to the QUICKTAG.REQ file. You can (and should)
use the field 'username' to show the user he has registered Quicktag. So,
somewhere on your main screen there's a line "Registered to:". If there's no
(valid) QUICKTAG.KEY file, replace this line by "Unregistered Demo Version".

This should be enough to write your own Quicktag program.
Need more information? Just Ask!!


PROBLEMS
AND OTHER NOT SUPPORTED FEATURES

If you thought you bought a bugfree module for The Major BBS, you're wrong:
there is no such thing as bugfree. However, we have removed EVERY know bug or
strange behaviour from Major CD. The module has been tested over and over again
(thanks to all betatesters). There is no bug or strange behaviour we know of.
However, most of the calls we get are related to getting it to work'. With
this manual we've tried to do something about that. If you are having some
problems setting it up, please read the manual again. Be sure to run CD-Check
before adding a Btrieve file of any CD to your master list.
Major CD has a special debug mode you can activate when something is wrong.
This mode is especial handy if you're getting a lot of error retrieving'
messages. To activate the debug mode you have to do the following:
- Logon to your system as an user with the MASTER-key
- Go to Major CD
- Type "MJRCDDEBUG" (without the quotes)
- Major CD will confirm your command with "Debug status ON"
- Hit return to get a menu back
ALERT!!: When you activate the debug mode, Major CD will spit out A LOT of
messages about what it is doing. Those messages are send to anybody who uses
Major CD, even to DEMO users.
To switch the debug status off again, type "MJRCDDEBUG" again.
When the debug status is on, Major CD will let you know what it is doing. Pay
special attention to the paths (and drive) the module is searching to find the
file and the path it wants to write the file. 

HIDDEN OPTIONS?
If you walk through the Major CD message file (MR_MJRCD.MSG or option 6 of the
Major BBS configuration editor), you will notice some menu option not described
in this manual. Is it a backdoor? Is it a hidden option? No it's Superman!!
(sorry, writing manuals is so boring).
There's a complete set of sysop commands underneath' Major CD. We use those
options during betatests of Major CD and to adjust little problems in the
Btrieve files. Normally a programmer removes those options before shipping his
module, but we decided not to. If you know the structure of Major CD and its
Btrieve files and want to make little corrections to one of the Btrieve files,
those options are very handy. If you don't know anything about Btrieve
structures and that kind of stuff, those options will not harm you. So we
decided to leave them there, just for the Power Sysop'. However, if you don't
know what you're doing you can destroy the Major CD Btrieve file pretty quick.
Before you even want to look at those options: we do NOT support them!
(you can reach them by typing "account" or "menu" on any Major CD prompt).

IF EVEN THE MANUAL FAILS
If your system grow and you add more and more modules the change that you get a
crash of GP will grow with it. It is even possible that Major CD has bugs, if
you find any let us know and we will fix it as soon as possible.
If you installed or updated Major CD and "can't get it to work" we will always
be there to assist you: just call, fax, mail or smoke-signal us and we help you
out as fast as we can. To support you as good as we can, we need your help. If
you get a GP that points to Major CD: E-mail us the GP.OUT file. Talking of
GP's: although they are pretty helpful when you want to debug your system, they
are not always right. Sometimes they point to a module that didn't cause the
GP. If you're getting GP's on a regular basis, the best thing to do is to
disable the module you think is causing the problem. If the GP points to that
module AND the problem disappear after removing the module is it probable the
module. Send us that GP.OUT file together with a extended description of your
system (computer type, number of lines (how many are busy when the problem
occurs), number of CD-Players, brand of CD-Players and so on). The more
information you give us, the better we can support you.
But remember: don't be afraid to call us. We want Major CD to be (one of) the
best supported Major BBS modules. If you need any help, if you have any
question or if you just want to talk to someone about the weather: JUST CALL
US!!






MAJOR CD 
AT THE USERS TERMINAL

This part of this manual is special written for the users of the systems
running Major CD. It's included in this manual because it contains information
the sysop should be aware of.

One of the best things of online communication is the possibility to share
files with other users. Over the last ten years programmers created millions of
files starting with a little line editor for MS-DOS version 2.0 to full blown
spreadsheets for MS-DOS 6.0. If you need a program, we got it.
There are two areas on our system where you can locate files. The first place
is our File Library, the other place is our CD-ROM Library. Major CD, the
module we use to handle our CD(s), is one of the most powerful CD-ROM managers
in the communication industry. We won't bother you with technical details, you
will soon find out how easy it is to use.

Major CD has three kind of user modes: ASCI and ANSI (and RIP of course). You
can set you personal preference in the module itself. The ANSI-mode uses about
every ANSI-code you can think off, including scrolling up, scrolling down and a
lot of color coding. To use this ANSI-mode your terminal program must
understand every ANSI-code the CD-ROM Manager uses. Some terminal programs
don't. If the ANSI-mode doesn't work for your terminal program, you can switch
to another terminal program or use the ASCI-mode of our CD-ROM Manager. But try
some configuration options of your terminal program first. For example the
VT100 emulation of the program Q-Modem is, for some reason, more ANSI
compatible than the ANSI emulation. Another thing to note is your screen
length: be sure the setting of your account match the number of lines your
screen can handle.

If you enter the CD-ROM Manager our system will show you a list of CD's we have
online. If you select one of them you will see all the possible file areas of
that CD. After your selection you will get to the main part of the CD-ROM
Manager. Expert note: our system supports command stacking, so you can jump
straight to the main part by entering the separate choices on one line.

When you reached the main part of the CD-ROM manager, you'll see a menu that
looks something like this:

   (You downloaded 351 files sofar)

   A => List all files
   L => List files starting at....
   T => Tag a file for download
   U => Upload Quicktag (tm) file
   S => Show Tag-list
   C => Change to another LIB
   F => Find a file in this LIB
   G => Global search on this CD
   M => Mass search on all CD's
   ! => Toggle Ansi-Tagger (now OFF)
   H => Help

 Current CD-ROM: 1 Lib: 1    Files Tagged: 0
Select (A,L,T,U,S,C,F,G,M,!,H) or eXit:

At the top of the menu you'll see how many files you have downloaded from our
CD-ROM's ever. This number is only for your reference, we won't blame you -:)

At the bottom of the menu you'll see the number of the CD and the number of the
library you have selected. The usage of the CD-ROM Manager depends on you
personal preferences. If your terminal program is able to handle ANSI codes, we
suggest you try this mode first. You can toggle the ANSI-mode On and Off with
the ! option.

There are two ways to see which files are on the CD and library you have
selected: option A and L. Option L will ask you to give a starting point and
option A will start with the very first file.
The moment you have selected either one of the A or L option The CD-ROM Manager
will show you a screen full of files. In the ASCI-mode the list is hold with a
"(N)onstop, (Q)uit or (C)ontinue" line. If you select Quit the list function is
aborted. Continue gives you the next screen of files and Nonstop will keep
showing you files until the end of the library is reached (or you pressed the
enter key). If you want to tag a file for download, you'll have to memorize the
file name(s) and use the [T]ag option of the menu (we will discus later).

If you selected the ANSI-mode of our CD-ROM Manager, things are a little more
powerful. After activating the A or L option, you will again see a screen full
of files. However, on the top most file you will also notice a selection bar.
You can move this selection bar up and down using your cursor keys (if you
cursor keys won't work, you can also use the 8 for up and 2 for down). You can
tag or untag a file by hitting the space bar. Any file you have tagged will
have an asterix in front of its name. You can also move the selection bar a
full page up or down by using the Page-Up and Page-Down key (again: if they
don't work use the 9 key for page up and 3 for page down).
At the bottom of your screen you will see a reminder of the keys you can use.
You will also see two numbers in this help-line: the first tells you how many
files you have selected the second how many selection entries' are left. Your
taglist can only hold a limited number of files.
Once you have selected some files you can leave the full screen tagger with the
S key (save selection). This way your selection-list is send out as file
requests. If you hit the A (for abort) or Q (for Quit) key you will leave the
full screen tagger with an empty selection list.

If you don't want (or can't) use the ANSI-mode you'll have to tag files with
the T option from the menu. After selecting the T option, the system will ask
you to enter the filename(s) of the file(s) you want to tag. You can enter
multiple files on one line if you like. Because most of our files do have .ZIP
as an extension the CD-ROM Manager uses this extension as a default. If you
want to tag a file that doesn't have an extension end the file name with a dot.
If the file you want has ZIP as an extension you don't have to type it in. Here
is an example of valid entry:

TEST.GIF  MYFILE   NOEXT.  NEXTONE.ARC  GREAT

This will tag the following files:
TEST.GIF
MYFILE.ZIP
NOEXT
NEXTONE.ARC
GREAT.ZIP

It's also possible to tag files from another library. If you do a CD-wide
search the CD-ROM Manager will show you files that are not in your current
library. To tag those files, just start the filename with the Library number.
Here is another example of a valid entry:

10:TEST.GIF  MYFILE   14:NOEXT.  NEXTONE.ARC  27:GREAT

This will tag the following files:
TEST.GIF 		from Library 10
MYFILE.ZIP 		from your current Library
NOEXT 		from Library 14
NEXTONE.ARC 	from your current Library
GREAT.ZIP 		from Library 27


After you have tagged some files, either with the full screen tagger or the Tag
option the filenames are added to your BBS-wide taglist. However, to give you
maximum speed with downloading we will not let you download from our CD-ROM
itself. Instead the files you have requested are first moved to our supersonic
hard drive. This means you can't start downloading right away: you'll have to
wait until the files are moved from the CD to our hard drive.

You don't have to wait for them: just keep on using our system, read some mail,
play some games or whatever you like. Everytime the CD-ROM Manager has moved
one of your files to our hard drive, you'll be notified. 
You can follow the process by yourself if you like. There's a system wide
global command which will show you your current taglist. If you type "/Show" on
any prompt in the system, you'll see your current taglist. The files you have
selected from our CD(s) have a special mark. They are listed as "Qued" or
"Retrieved". The "Retrieved" files are ready for download, the "Qued" files are
not moved to our hard drive yet.
Expert Note: Soon you will know the time it takes to retrieve a file from our
CD-ROM(s). You can start downloading when the first file of your taglist is
"Retrieved". The CD-ROM Manager will probably catch up' with you.
BTW: You don't have to go to the CD-ROM manager to download your selected (and
retrieved!) files. You can select download at several places on our system (for
example within the File Library). If you try to logoff before you downloaded
your taglist' the system will intercept your logoff and ask you if you want to
download the files first.

FINDING THE FILE(S)
If you are looking for a specific file our system selects several ways to find
them online. In the main menu of the CD-ROM manager you'll see three kind of
search options.

   F => Find a file in this LIB
   G => Global search on this CD
   M => Mass search on all CD's

With the F command you can search for a file in the library and CD you have
selected. The G command let you search through all libraries of the selected CD
and with the M command you can search all libraries of all CD's you have access
to.
After selecting one of the options, the system will ask you to enter a keyword
to search for. The CD-ROM manager will search both the file names and the
descriptions for the keyword you have entered.
When you have entered the keyword the CD-ROM manager will start the search
process. The speed of this search depends on several things: finding a file in
one library is of course a lot faster than a mass search. It also depends on
the number of lines that are currently in use. The CD-ROM manager will take as
much processor time as possible, but will not slow down the process of the
other users. Finding a file in a library is done within a minute but a mass
search can take several minutes.
The search option will show every file that complies to you searchkey. When
your screen is filled, you will see the "(Q)uit, (N)onstop, (C)ontinue" line.
Quit will abort the search process, Nonstop will keep on searching without
giving you a new "(Q)uit, (N)onstop, (C)ontinue" line and Continue will search
for the next page of files. You can always abort the search function by hitting
the Return key.

QUICKTAG: USING THE CD-ROM MANAGER OFFLINE
Our CD-ROM manager has some special support for the Quicktag protocol. With
quicktag you can search, browse and tag files offline. Your selection is saved
in a little request file. You can upload this request file right into our CD-
ROM manager tagging your selection within a second.
There are several shareware programs supporting Quicktag. By the time of this
writing we have found a MSDOS, a Microsoft Windows and a Atari ST version. To
use any of those Quicktag programs you'll need to register it. Please read the
information supplied with the Quicktag program of your choice, or ask your
sysop about it.
Second you'll need the Quicktag description files of the CD's this BBS has
online.

RIPTERM SUPPORT
If you like a graphical user interface (GUI) like Microsoft Windows, you should
take a look at a communication program called RipTerm. If your BBS supports RIP
(Remote Image Protocol) you'll be able to use the system with your mouse. If
your BBS supports RIP you'll notice a complete different user interface of the
CD-ROM manager to: all the functions are there, but you can select them with
your mouse. For example: the full screen RIP-tagger let you tag files by
pointing with your mouse.

GIVE US SOME FEEDBACK

Major CD is the result of an excellent idea, several years of hard work, many
ours of beta testing but most of all: some terrific feedback from our
customers. If you think Major CD is missing an option, should perform better if
we change something, would be one of a kind' if we add something: LET US KNOW!

    User Account Display/Edit
    -------------------------

    This service allows you to:

     o  View some statistics on your account
     o  Edit many of the answers you gave when you first signed up
     o  Transfer credits from your account to another


    Credits

    Some BBSes track your usage or charge for your usage by issuing
    "credits".  Being online consumes credits and using various services
    also consumes credits.  If the BBS does deal with credits then you'll
    see them in your account menu:

        User-ID:  Arthur Berg
        Credits:  693150

        S => Display statistics on your account
        A => Display or edit account information (address/phone/password)
        T => Transfer credits to another user

     Your choice (or 'X' to exit):


    S = Display Statistics on your Account

    This choice shows you a few statistics on your account.

        User-ID:  Arthur Berg

        S => Display statistics on your account
        A => Display or edit account information (address/phone/password)
        T => Transfer credits to another user

     Your choice (or 'X' to exit): S

      User-ID .................... Arthur Berg
      Account Created ............ 02/09/91
      Last Logon ................. 05/14/92
      Account Class............... CUSTOMER
      Time Limit Per Call......... UNLIMITED
      Time Limit Per Day.......... UNLIMITED
      ANSI setting this session .. ON


        User-ID:  Arthur Berg

        S => Display statistics on your account
        A => Display or edit account information (address/phone/password)
        T => Transfer credits to another user

     Your choice (or 'X' to exit):

    Your account was created when you first signed up.  The day you last
    logged on, (prior to your current session) is recorded also.

    Your class determines how long you can stay online and what services
    you are allowed to use, and on some systems, whether you are charged
    for using the BBS or not.  In the above example, Arthur has no limits
    on how long he can stay online.  The ANSI-ON condition means that his
    terminal is receiving color and cursor movement commands from the BBS.
    You can change your ANSI setting if you like.  More on that below.


    A = Editing Your Account Information

    On most BBSes, you can edit your answers to the sign-up questions.  You
    won't be able to change your User-ID, though.  And some custom
    questions are only asked at sign-up, and can't be changed later.

    The Full Screen Data Entry service is used to change your account
    information if your terminal has ANSI capability.  You'll see all your
    account information on screen.  Use your up and down arrows keys to
    move around to different fields.  To retype a field, just type over the
    old information.  To change a field, start by moving the cursor right
    or left to the correct position.  Then type over the old stuff, or:

     <Del> or <Backspace>     delete a character
     <CTRL-F>                 insert a character

    See below for editing your account information when you don't have ANSI
    (using the Linear Data Entry service).

    You can leave this screen any time by hitting one of these keystrokes:

     <CTRL-S>    Save your changes and exit
     <CTRL-Q>    Quit and abandon your changes


    Name, Address, Phone Numbers

    On some of these fields there are certain minimum lengths required.
    You'll be notified if your answer is too short.  This information is
    treated by most Sysops as highly confidential.  It would be used mainly
    to contact you in the event of a question or problem with your account.
    Many Sysops also use this information to mail announcements,
    newsletters, etc.


    Computer System

    On some systems, different menus are provided for users that have IBM
    computers and users that don't.  IBM computers as terminals can display
    a wide variety of special extended ASCII characters, including box
    borders, shading, international characters, etc.  The only other impact
    of this question is on demographic statistics that the Sysop can see.


    ANSI Preference

    This answer concerns whether or not your terminal should be receiving
    ANSI commands for cursor positioning, colors, and other attributes.

     ON       ANSI commands will be sent to your terminal

     OFF      ANSI commands will not be sent to your terminal

     AUTO     Each time you log on, the BBS will decide whether
              or not to send ANSI commands to your terminal.  The BBS
              may automatically detect whether you have ANSI or not,
              or it may ask you, or it may be prewired by the Sysop
              to be on or off.

    Usually you can leave it set to AUTO.  But if this appears to be making
    the wrong choice sometimes, you can change it.  If you see bland
    colorless text on your color monitor, set it to ON.  If you see lots of
    annoying bracket characters with numbers and letters after them, like
    "[33m" or "[0;1;47;52m", you may want to set it to OFF.


    Screen Dimensions and Pausing

    Here are some examples of different screen configurations:

     Screen size: 80 columns by 24 lines
     Pause output?  PAUSE
                                 Standard 80x24 terminal, the BBS pauses
                                 when it has 23 or more lines to display

     Screen size: 80 columns by 24 lines
     Pause output?  CONTINUOUS
                                 Standard 80x24 terminal, the BBS doesn't
                                 pause, display is continuous

     Screen size: 80 columns by 43 lines
     Pause output?  PAUSE
                                 Enlarged 80x43 terminal, pause each 41
                                 lines


    Password

    Your password appears as a string of asterisks (****).  You can retype
    your password once in a while to keep your account secure.


    Save or Quit

    When you're done editing, you can answer the question at the bottom:

     SAVE        Save your changes and exit
     QUIT        Quit and abandon your changes

    Just pick S or Q and hit RETURN to exit the service back to the User
    Account Display/Edit menu.


    Editing your Account when you don't have ANSI

    If your terminal doesn't have ANSI capability or if your screen isn't
    long enough (24 lines is enough), then editing your account information
    will have to proceed one question at a time.

    Use the RETURN key to skip each field you don't want to change.  When
    you get to a field you want to change, you can back up over the
    information that's already there and type new information, or just
    start typing in completely new information.

     To edit the information that's there,    start with a <Backspace>.

     To replace the information that's there, start by typing the first
                                              character of the new
                                              information

    If you make a mistake, just use:

     <Ctrl-U>     to back up one field.


    T = Transferring credits

    With the Sysop's permission, you can transfer credits from your account
    to another user's account.  There's usually a minimum amount you can
    transfer.  By default it's 600 credits.  Just select the T option if
    you wish to transfer some of your credits to another user account.


    FILE LIBRARIES
    --------------

    The File Libraries is an online service which makes a large number of
    files available for you to download. If it's allowed, you can also
    contribute to the File Libraries by uploading files.


    The Current Library

    A Library is like a single DOS directory of files. You always have a
    current Library or default Library. When you first log on, you're in the
    default Library for the BBS.  However, if you select a different
    Library, it will be your default Library the next time you log on. The
    Library menu header shows you what Library you're in:


    Welcome to the MAIN Library.
    Description: A general-purpose file area.

    There are 8 files available for download.

    However, searches can be configured to include all Libraries.


    Full Screen Displays

    The File Libraries normally uses full screen displays, if your terminal
    program has ANSI or RIP capability. This greatly simplifies the process
    of working with long lists of files. Without ANSI, selection screens
    will scroll by a line at a time.


    File Names

    Files can be named just like DOS files, with one to eight characters, a
    dot (.), and zero to three characters:

    FILENAME.EXT

    File names can include letters (converted to upper case), numbers, and
    these punctuation symbols:

    !  #  $  &  '  (  )  -  @  ^  _  `

    All the files within a Library must have a unique name.


    Wildcards

    Wildcards are used to specify the name of a file when you don't know the
    exact name of the file or you want to specify multiple files. For
    example:

    auto*.*              any filename which starts with "auto"

    *.zip                all files with the extension of "zip"

    patch?.zip           any filename which starts with "patch" followed by any
                         single character and with the extension of "zip"

    In the preceding examples, * means match any string (0 or more
    characters), ? means match any single character. You can use wildcards
    in most places where you're asked to enter a filename.


    Download Pricing

    The BBS may charge your account for downloading files. When you get a
    detailed description of a file, you can see an estimate of the download
    charges. This estimate tries to take into account the duration of the
    download on your session and the cost of connect time - you may see the
    amount drop if you call back at a higher baud rate.

    If the amount of credits you have is close to this estimate, you may or
    may not be able to complete the download.


    Tagging Files for Download

    When searching through files, you don't have to download a file
    immediately. Instead, you can tag it for later download. You may want to
    do this if you'd rather download all the files you've found at the end
    of your session or if you're not sure if you really want a particular
    file. You can remove the file from the tagged file list before you start
    downloading if you decide you don't want it or you found the correct
    file later in your searching. See the section on Managing Tagged Files.


    S = Selecting a Library

    If the BBS has multiple Libraries, this command will appear in the File
    Libraries menu. You select a particular Library by typing:

    S <Library name>

    Type S? to get a list of all the Libraries available on the BBS.


    D = Download a File

    If you know the name of the file you want to download, type:

    D <filename> <optional protocol>

    If the file exists in any Library or if you used a wildcard in the file
    name, the download will start right away. If many files in different
    Libraries have the same name, you will get a search screen to select the
    ones you want.


    F = Find Files

    Select the F option from the Library menu if you want to list files
    available or search for a particular file. You can list files in
    alphabetical order, by date, by number of downloads or you can search by
    file name or keyword. Setting your Library preferences will affect the
    choices you will have. In any case, you will get a search screen listing
    the files you requested. You will be able to get detailed information on
    any file, download a file immediately, tag files for later download, or
    view the contents of a file.


    R = Resuming a Search

    If you exit to the Library menu in the middle of a search list, you will
    find a new menu selection, R, to resume where you left off.


    T = Manage Tagged Files

    Select the T option to download files you have tagged. This option is
    only visible when you have files tagged. You will be given a list of the
    files you have tagged. You can untag any or all of them at this time. If
    you have tagged more than one file, you can download them all at once.

    Even if you don't bother downloading your tagged files before exiting
    the File Libraries menu, you can return later in your session to
    download them. You will also be given a chance to download them before
    you log off. If you log off, however, or are disconnected for any reason
    without downloading the files, your list of tagged files will be lost.


    L = Download Lists of Files

    Select L to download a list of all the files in a Library or all the
    files in all Libraries if you prefer to search for files offline.


    U = Upload a File

    Select U to upload files. Enter the name of the file you wish to upload
    and select the file transfer protocol. With most terminal programs, you
    would now press <PgUp> to specify the file on your computer and start
    the upload. After the upload completes, you will be prompted to enter a
    description for the file. If you uploaded multiple files (using a
    multi-file upload protocol), you will be prompted to enter descriptions
    for each of the files.

    You can upload several files at once using one of the batch file
    protocols by typing * instead of a file name. You can choose a multi-file
    upload protocol from among:

    Enter file name, *, M, ? for more help, or X to exit: *

    To start uploading these files, type:

       B ... YMODEM Batch                    Z ... ZMODEM
       G ... YMODEM-g                        K ... Kermit

       (Add '!' to automatically log off when done.)

       Your choice (or 'X' to exit):_

    In these cases, you don't need to tell the BBS the name of the file. The
    same file name will be used on the BBS as is used on your computer.
    That's possible because these protocols transmit the name of the file Q
    as well as its exact size, time, and date Q before transmitting the
    contents.

    You can use U* even when uploading only one file. That way, you don't
    have to type in the file name twice.

    A Library has an upper limit on the size and number of files it can
    contain as well as the size of each uploaded file. Usually, you can see
    these limits when you select the Upload option.

    In some Libraries, your uploaded file may not be available for other
    users to download until the Sysop or Library Operator approves the file.

    Library Operators are notified of unapproved files in their Libraries
    when they log on.  Usually, you can see the name of the Primary Library
    Operator when you select a Library.

    On systems that charge for usage, you may get a royalty for an uploaded
    file when another user downloads it. When the download completes, if
    charges are deducted from the downloader's account, then the uploader
    may get a percentage credited to his account.

    The charges based on the number and sizes of the files are subject to
    the royalty. Connect time charges during download are not subject to the
    royalty.

    You can modify the description of a file you uploaded or re-upload it if
    necessary. Select U as if you were uploading a file the first time.

    Enter the file name of the original file to re-upload or M to modify the
    description.


    P = Set Your Preferences

    The preferences menu allows you to specify a preferred file transfer
    protocol or configure your default method of file listing and searching.

    You can also request that you be asked to specify those options each
    time you transfer a file or initiate a search.

     Tournament Checkers (Written by: Tessier Technologies, INC)
     -----------------------------------------------------------

     Tournament checkers brings the original board game to life
     on the Majorbbs.  Features included Multiple games, ratings,
     and saved games.  This module will provide hours of fun.




    Game Connection (tm)
    Version 1.4 User Documentation
    -------------------------------

    Game Connection allows you to play modem-to-modem games while
    logged onto this system.  With the two player games, this may
    allow you to play the game with someone who is not in your area,
    which would previously have cost you long distance charges, or to
    play a game with someone without having to give them your home
    phone number.  The real advantage here is the ability to play
    multi-player (i.e.  more than two player) games online.  This
    ability depends on the version of this program running on this
    system, as there is a two-player only version of Game Connection,
    and a multi-player version.

    Multi-player modem games would normally require one user to have
    several phones and modems, or are only playable by more than two
    persons if connected by a LAN.  Using Game Connection, you can
    play supported multi-player games as easily as the two player
    versions.


                          Beginning a Game
                          ----------------

    The first thing to is to call a Major BBS and enter Game
    Connection.  Some games have a chat mode that will allow you to do
    this from within them, but the majority require you to pre-dial.

    Pre-dialing refers to calling the BBS with your normal
    communications program (e.g. Telix, Procomm) in order to log on,
    enter Game Connection, and begin game mode.  This is explained in
    more detail below.  Make sure any notes on modem configuration are
    taken into account.  Some games require special modem
    configuration.

     NOTE: It is usually a good idea to have everyone at the same
     baud rate.  If you are not, game data may be lost if a low speed
     system is not able to accept the data as fast as the higher speed
     system(s) send it.

    After entering Game Connection, a menu selection allows you to see
    what other users on the system have set their game request flag,
    and which game they are interested in playing.  You can also get a
    list of all players currently in Game Connection, and their status
    (e.g.  Playing DOOM).

    To play a game, select the menu option to enter a multi-player game
    channel.  You can join one of the existing games if it is not
    already in progress, or you can set up your own game channel, which
    you will be the moderator of.

    FOR TWO PLAYER GAMES, USE DISTRIBUTED MODE.  This will allow
    virtually any game that is not specifically supported by Game
    Connection to be played two-way.

    Some games allow open entry.  The only one that we know of at this
    time is Spectre VR.  Open entry means that a player can enter a
    game while it is in progress.  To do this, make sure that the game
    is not full (8 players for Spectre VR), and enter your game.



                             Moderating

    Setting up a game channel is just a matter of answering a couple
    of questions:

          Which game will be played?

    Just enter the name of the game you are planning to play.  This
    will allow other users to join you if they wish to play the same
    game.

          Playing mode?

    Several playing modes are available.

    The default selection is "Distributed" mode.  In this mode,
    everything coming from one player will be sent (distributed) to
    each of the other players.  This mode is not useful for most
    games with more than two players, but works well for two-player
    games.  Of course, you are always welcome to try this mode for
    games that do not have their own mode and do not follow one of the
    standard protocols provided by Game Connection, but it is not
    likely to work.

    If you cannot get a 'more than two player' game to work in
    distributed mode, you may wish to attempt another non-game specific
    mode.  Such as "Master-Slave" mode.  Some games use this method,
    and can be played even though they are not directly supported.  For
    instance, it has been reported that Syndicate works in this mode.

    "Master-Slave" mode assumes one player is the master and sends
    all data from him/her to everyone else, while routing all data from
    the slaves to his/her channel only.  You may have some luck with
    this mode if the game is designed to have everyone call a master
    system and that system takes care of all communications.  By
    default, the first player to enter the channel (the moderator) is
    assigned the position of master.  The help text displayed when you
    enter the channel gives instructions for passing that position to
    another channel member.

    "Daisy Chained" mode is not likely to work.  It was thrown in
    just in case a need for it arose.  In this mode, everything is
    passed from one user to the next, and they are responsible for
    echoing it to the next player, or stopping it if they originated
    it.

    Two standard protocols are provided to allow games to be written
    for Game Connection: The Game Connection Protocol (GCP) is a binary
    protocol that is currently being used in game development, and
    Line Mode is an ASCII based protocol for games that wish to be
    compatible with 7-bit networks.  Additionally, GCP7 is a seven bit
    variation of the GCP protocol for the control of GCP, but the
    ability to operate over 7-bit networks.

    All other modes are game specific (e.g. "Empire Deluxe" mode), and
    are special modes for particular games.  If you have a
    multi-player game that is not specifically supported by Game
    Connection, you are welcome to try these modes, but don't expect
    too much.


                              Commands

    Once a channel is setup, you are in a mini-teleconference.  There
    are a number of commands that can be done from here before the
    game starts, such as JOIN another channel.  These commands are
    listed as you enter, and help is available online.

    If you are the channel moderator, you have additional
    capabilities.  You can remove people from the channel, limit the
    number of players who may enter, change the playing mode, etc.
    Again, these commands are listed when you enter the channel.

    When everyone is ready, the moderator can begin game mode by typing
    START.




                          Playing the Game
                          ----------------

    Once you are in game mode, after typing START, you need to exit
    your communications program, unless you called through your game
    or a front end such as SIRDOOM, and bring up the game.  Shelling
    out is usually not sufficient, as most games require a lot of
    memory.

    Your games will then be in contact with each other, and you can
    play them as normal.  Make sure you have called the BBS at a baud
    rate supported by the game, and that the game is configured to use
    that speed.  If the game tries to use a speed other than what you
    called at, the data will not make it through to the other side.

    Most games have a direct connect mode to use a null modem cable or
    an established modem connection; this is the communications mode
    you will need to select.


                           Ending the Game
                           ---------------

    When the game is over, you will need to go back into your
    communications program again, unless you called through your game,
    and type a series of Ctrl-Z's.  After about two seconds of
    inactivity following the Ctrl-Z's, you will be returned to the
    mini-teleconference.



                           Supported Games
                           ---------------

   Most two-player games (or multi-player games in two-player mode)
   will work flawlessly in Game Connection.  Some, however, do not have
   a chat mode that would allow you to log on to the BBS, and insist on
   hanging the modem up and dialing themselves.  These games will not
   function via Game Connection.

   We are constantly in the process of adding specific support for more
   games, and working on known incompatibilities and problems with
   supported games.  Below is a list of the games that either we have
   tested, or have been reported to work, along with comments about
   their performance.  If you find a game that is not listed here, or
   that you have alternate comments on, please have your sysop contact
   Sirius Software, Inc. and let us know the name of the game, the
   developer, and any success or failures you've had with the game.

   Read the notes on the game you are attempting to play prior to
   calling the BBS.  Some games require special modem configuration.

   If a game hangs up on you when attempting to begin the game, or in
   the middle of the game, there are a couple of ways to get around it.
   One is to add &D0 to your modem init string prior to dialing.  If
   the game is dropping the DTR signal to your modem, the modem will
   automatically disconnect unless this configuration option is used.
   You will have to hang your modem up manually if you do this,
   however, since most modems are hung up by dropping DTR.

   The second possibility is that the game is sending +++ to put your
   modem in command mode, and then issuing a hangup command.  This can
   be disabled by adding S2=255 to your modem initialation string prior
   to dialing.

   NOTE:

     * Multi-player games require the multi-player version of Game
         Connection for more than two players.

     Pre-dial - means that you will have to call a Major BBS system
          with a com program (such as Telix or Procomm), enter
          Game Connection, and go into game mode prior to running
          the game.  These games do not have a chat mode that would
          allow you to log on and get to Game Connection from within
          the game.

          When you pre-dial for a game, select the option that says
          "Direct Connection", "Established Connection", or "Serial
          Connection" if available.  There is no need to select modem,
          because you do not need to initialize or dial.

          When pre-dialing from Windows, you will have to minimize your
          com program, but leave it active, or Windows will disconnect
          you from the BBS.

Descent (Interplay)    Up to 8 players                 (shareware)

     If the system you call is running the multi-player version of Game
     Connection V1.46 or higher, then you can play this games with
     2 to 8 players using the SIRDESC front end.  Otherwise, see
     the general two player instructions in SIRGCONN.DOC.

     Dial Method: Dial from SIRDESC's built in ANSI terminal

     Baud Rates: 14.4K or higher

     Comments: Unzip the SIRDESC front end into your Descent directory,
          or preferably, somewhere in your path, so you can use it to
          play from any directory on your system.  Both SIRDESC.EXE and
          SIRCFG.EXE should be placed in the same directory for proper
          operation.

          The first time you run SIRDESC, the configuration editor will
          be run automatically.  You can run it at any time after
          that by pressing Alt-C.  See SIRDESC.DOC for complete
          instructions.

          SIRDESC and Descent Mode were designed to work together.
          In order to use SIRDESC, you must select Descent Mode.
          SIRDESC will not work with other modes, and the odds of any
          other Descent loader working in this mode are nil.

          Once you are in game mode, that is about it.  One player
          needs to host the game by typing Alt-S.  SIRDESC will
          automatically pull the rest of the players in, and return you
          to teleconference mode when you complete the game. (You will
          not have to type Ctrl-Z's)

          Again, if you have any questions or problems, see SIRDESC.DOC.


DOOM    (ID Software)    Up to 4 players               (shareware)
DOOM II (ID Software)    Up to 4 players
HERETIC (ID Software)    Up to 4 players

     If the system you call is running the multi-player version of Game
     Connection V1.40 or higher, then you can play these games with
     2 to 4 players using the SIRDOOM front end (V1.45 or higher is
     required for Heretic, and SIRDOOM V2.0 or higher).  Otherwise, you
     will need to use the default serial drivers and will be limited to
     two way games.

     NOTE: Heretic is based on DOOM's graphics and communications
     engine.  Since a suitable front end was already in use, we added
     Heretic support directly to SIRDOOM instead of creating a new
     front end.  SIRDOOM will automatically detect Heretic and make all
     necessary adjustments to game configuration and communications.

     Dial Method: Dial from SIRDOOM's built in ANSI terminal

     Baud Rates: Any

     Comments: Unzip the SIRDOOM front end into your DOOM or Heretic
          directory, or preferably, somewhere in your path, so you can
          use one copy to play DOOM, DOOM II, or Heretic.  Both
          SIRDOOM.EXE and SDCONFIG.EXE should be placed in the same
          directory for proper operation.

          The first time you run SIRDOOM, the configuration editor will
          be run automatically.  You can run it at any time after
          that by pressing Alt-C.  See SIRDOOM.DOC for complete
          instructions.

          SIRDOOM and DOOM Mode were designed to work together.
          Likewise, HERETIC mode was designed with SIRDOOM in mind. In
          order to use SIRDOOM, you must select either DOOM mode or
          HERETIC mode (depending on the game you will be playing).
          SIRDOOM will not work with other modes, and the odds of any
          other DOOM or Heretic loader working in this mode are nil.

          Once you are in game mode, that is about it.  One player
          needs to host the game by typing Alt-S.  SIRDOOM will
          automatically pull the rest of the players in, and return you
          to teleconference mode when you complete the game. (You will
          not have to type Ctrl-Z's)

          Again, if you have any questions or problems, see SIRDOOM.DOC.


Warpath (Synthetic Reality)  Up to 4 players           (shareware)

     Dial Method: Build in terminal

     Baud Rates: Determined by Windows

     Comments: A great space war and economics game for Windows.  This
          is the first game released with native Game Connection
          support, so let's try to keep the ball rolling by supporting
          the author.  The game contains instructions for registration.

          Unzip WARPATH.ZIP into a subdirectory and add a Windows
          program item pointing to WARPATH.EXE in that directory.  Open
          that program, select options and configure your modem
          options, then select 'New Game', Modem, 'Play Game', and then
          Dial.  (NOTE: The built in terminal does not support ANSI, so
          if you have your ANSI setting to always on, you will have to
          turn it off or ignore the ANSI codes.)  Once you are in Game
          Connection, select 'Line Mode', type START, and one of the
          players clicks on 'Host Game' to begin.

          Complete, context-sensitive help is available.


Spades (Synthetic Reality)  Up to 4 players           (shareware)

     Dial Method: Build in terminal

     Baud Rates: Determined by Windows

     Comments: A good rendition of the classic spades card game.
          Allows solo or partner play, with 1 to 4 human players,
          with additional seats being filled by robots.

          Complete, context-sensitive help is available.


Spectre VR  (Velocity)   Up to 8 players

     Dial Method: Pre-dial

     Baud Rates: Any (skips from 19.2K to 57.6K, ie. no 38.4K)

     Setup: Execellent Virtual Reality game.

          Select direct connect under network setup.

          If the BBS you are calling has the multi-player version of
          Game Connection V1.40 or greater, there is a mode for this
          game that will allow 2-8 players in the same game.  No front
          end or patch is required.

          This game allows open entry.  Once the game is started, other
          players will be allowed to enter unless you have limited the
          number of users in the channel.

          When you enter, it will notify you that you are in game mode.
          Run SVR as normal and try to click on PLAY between flashes
          (or just type P).

          This game seems to conflict with a number of TSRs.  If you
          get black boxes on some of the screens, or your screen goes
          completely black, try booting with only necessary drivers and
          TSRs.


Empire Deluxe  (New World Computing)  Up to 6 players

     Dial Method: Pre-dial

     Baud Rates: Up to 19200

     Comments: Modem initialization MUST include &D0.  This game drops
          DTR constantly, and without &D0, your modem will hang up.

          This game plays very well, and allows 2-6 players at a
          time out of the box.  Use Empire Deluxe mode for more than 2
          players.

          Once you are in game mode, exit your terminal program and run
          Empire.  Click on 'Play Game'.  All players but one should
          click on 'Remote Slave'.  The remaining player is the host or
          master player.  He/She should click on one of the game modes:
          Basic, Standard or Advanced and then decide what map will be
          used.

          Then the host should configure a slot for each player that
          will be in the game; setting each as remote via the same com
          port (the one your modem is on).

          Each person should select the appropriate baud rate (whatever
          you called in at) direct with automatic connect control.  All
          players should be at the same baud rate if possible.  The
          game should play even if they aren't, but it may lock up or
          play slowly.

          After that, click on OK, and you are started.

          If at all possible, the host should enter the game before the
          last player.  Otherwise, Game Connection will figure out who
          the host player is and start passing data.  This will allow
          player number requests to build up in the host's buffer and
          can confuse the game as to how many players there are which
          may cause odd behaviour.

          Don't be afraid to save the game and take it up again later.
          A large map and skilled players can drag Empire Deluxe games
          out for days.  Just exit the game, and it will prompt each
          player for a save file.  The next time you play, just chose
          'Load Saved Game'.  The only player who must save the game is
          the host, but the slave players will have to re-issue all
          commands when you resume play.


Global Conquest  (MicroPlay/Microprose)  Up to 4 players

     Dial Method: Pre-dial

     Baud Rates: Up to 19200

     Comments: Requires a patch to play over the BBS.  You will need to
          copy DRIVER2.OVL (from GLOBOVL.ZIP) into your Global Conquest
          directory.  Then, when you enter Global Conquest, select
          Special DRIVER2.OVL.

          NOTE: We were not able to get this game to play in 256 color
          mode, and the 16 color mode still had problems with the
          graphics.

     Comments: Plays well with modem connections, although currently a
          bit slow when played via an X.25 network such as Compuserve.

          You will need to replace SERIAL.OVL with the replacement in
          CHQOVL.ZIP from your Game Connection support library.

          This game limits the transmission speed to less than 2400
          bps, so anything faster will only be for your convenience
          when logging on.

    Major QWK-mail
    --------------

    In order to use Major QWK-mail, you must first have an offline quick
    mail reader such as SLMR, EZ-Reader, BlueWave, or Freddie.  Shareware
    versions of these programs are available on many BBSes.  The
    Galacticomm demo system, (305) 583-7808, has a shareware version of
    SLMR in the library of files.

    OPERATION

    You log onto the BBS, select the Major QWK-mail menu and request
    download of a QWK packet.  A QWK packet is a file with a filename
    unique to each BBS and the extension of .QWK.  Major QWK-mail scans for
    messages you have not yet read in the forums in your Quickscan, along
    with all private E-mail messages to you, and includes them in your QWK
    packet.

    You are requested to select one of The Major BBS file transfer
    protocols for download.  After the QWK packet is downloaded, you can
    log off and read the messages using your offline mail reader.  The
    offline reader will allow you to write responses and request file
    downloads.  These are assembled into a REP (reply) packet.  A REP
    packet is a file with the same filename as the QWK packet plus an
    extension of .REP.

    You now log back onto the BBS, select the Major QWK-mail menu and
    select upload of the REP packet.  You are requested to choose one of
    The Major BBS file transfer protocols for upload.  After the upload is
    complete, you can exit Major QWK-mail or log off the system.  The
    uploaded REP packet is queued behind other users' REP packets for
    processing.  It can take several minutes for your REP packet to be
    processed.  When the REP packet is processed, the reply messages are
    sent as if you did them online.  Requested files will be included in
    your next QWK packet.  You will be notified when processing of your REP
    packet is completed, if you are still online.

    MENU OPTIONS

    Here are the Major QWK-mail menu options:

    D - Download <bbs-filename>.QWK packet

    Downloads a QWK packet containing all messages you have not yet read
    either online or via Major QWK-mail.  You can filter the messages which
    are downloaded by configuring your forum Quickscan parameters.  Major
    QWK-mail displays each forum and the number of messages included in the
    packet while the QWK packet is being built.

    Major QWK-mail will ask you to specify the download protocol.  After
    the download successfully completes, your current message pointers will
    automatically be updated so that your next download will only include
    new messages.

    U - Upload <bbs-filename>.REP packet

    Uploads a REP packet which you built using your offline reader.  You
    will be asked to specify the upload protocol.

    If you are still online, you will be notified when processing of your
    REP packet has completed.  This can take many minutes due to REP
    packets queued ahead of yours.

    A - Attachment toggle (currently <ON|OFF>)

    When ON, this option includes file attachments in your QWK packet.
    Normally, you would leave this option OFF to prevent downloading large
    file attachments which you are not interested in.  You can request
    download of a file attachment you do want in your next REP packet, by
    writing E-mail to GALQWK with a topic field of REQUEST <#>, where <#>
    is the message number of the message whose attachment you want.

    R - Reset message pointers

    This resets your current message pointers to the message number you
    specify.  Normally, you don't have to change your message pointers,
    since Major QWK-mail automatically maintains them for you.

    However, if you are interested in downloading all messages since a
    certain date, you can reset the message pointers to the number of a
    message slightly older than the time you're interested in.  Your next
    download will include messages newer than the one specified.

    Resetting the message pointers to 1 will cause your next QWK download
    to include all messages in the forums in your Quickscan, along with all
    private E-mail messages to you.

    ? - Help

    Displays a screen of useful information on using Major QWK-mail.

    X - Exit, return to main menu

    Exits Major QWK-mail and returns to the menu tree.  Processing of REP
    packets will continue even if you exit Major QWK-mail or log off the
    BBS.


    Farwest Trivia
    --------------

    Farwest Trivia is similar to the Teleconference. It allows you to
    talk with the other users in the game, whisper, use actions, and
    forget those pesky users. All this while answering questions. You
    obtain points in the game by answer questions correctly.

    While in Trivia you can get a help screen by typing HELP or ?.
    This will give you a list of the commands you can use.

    Teleconference Style Commands

    ACTION ON/OFF/LIST    - Turn your ability to use actions on or off.
    EDIT                  - Edit your Trivia preferences.
    FORGET/REMEMBER <who> - "Forget" an annoying user, or "remember"
                            him/her.
    IGNORE/NOTICE <who>   - Ignore or notice just another user's actions.
    SCAN                  - Shows where everyone in Trivia is.
    /<who> <message>      - Sends a private message only to user <who>.
    ><who> <message>      - Directs a message to user <who>.
    X                     - Exit the Farwest Trivia game. :(


    Trivia Commands

    BEST or B............. Display the all time best scorers
    DISPLAY or D.......... Re-display current question
    HIGH or H............. Display the high scores
    Q# or Q............... Display the current question number
    SCORE or S............ Display YOUR current game score
    VERSION or V.......... Display the current version of Trivia

    Answering Questions

    Any text you type, whether it be a message to another player,
    an action, or a guess, is checked against the answer for an
    EXACT match. If what you typed exactly matches the answer to
    the question then you win, and are awarded one point.

    Action Words

    If you type ACTION at anytime you will get a list of the Action
    Words available to you. There are three basic types of actions.
    Solitary actions that are not directed towards anyone. Actions
    that you use on one other person, and group actions that you use
    on everyone.

    Use a solitary action by just typing the action word.

    Example:

      :laugh
      You are laughing your fool head off!

    You can use actions on other users by typing the the action word
    and then the userid of the person to use the action on. You can
    also initiate secret actions by appending the word "secretly" at
    the end.

    Example:

      :laugh Jane Doe
      You are laughing at Jane Doe.

      :laugh John Doe secretly
      You are laughing at John Doe.
      (secretly)

      :grin Joh s
      You are grinning at John Doe.
      (secretly)

    Note that you do not have to type the whole userid. You only have
    to type the portion so that the user in the game can be uniquely
    identified. (If there are two Johns in Trivia then Joh does not
    uniquely identify one of those users) Also not that the word
    secretly can be shortened to a simple "s".

    You can use group actions just by typing "all" behind the action
    word.

    Example:

      :laugh all
      You are laughing at everyone.

    Note that there is no guarantee that every action has all three
    types of responses.

                         IRC CLIENT for Major BBS
                         ========================


What is IRC?
============

IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat.  It was developed in 1988, as a
way for people on the Internet to chat with each other.  It is like
the Major BBS teleconference, except on a much wider scale.  Some
parts of the IRC have over 5000 people chatting at once.  There are
usually hundreds, if not thousands, of channels or topics to choose
from.


How does the IRC work?
======================

Here are the basics about the IRC.  You don't really need to know
the basics, but you may find it useful.

You are considered a client (technically, the client is the program 
you are using to access the IRC, but it's easier to think of the 
client being you).  If there are 5000 clients on the IRC, that 
means that there are 5000 users on the IRC.

You connect to a server.  The server could be anywhere on the 
Internet.  Servers pass information from one client to another.

Servers connect to other servers.  There can be lots of servers 
connected to each other, or only a few.  The more servers there
are, the more people can be on IRC.  However, the more servers 
there are, the slower things will run.

Each person (client) on IRC must have a unique nickname.  No other
person on any other server can have the same nickname.

There are also several "nets."  Each net is a group of servers 
that are all connected to each other.  EFNet is the most popular
net, and UnderNet is the next most popular.  You can not exchange
messages between people on different nets.



How do I use the IRC?
=====================

First of all, if you have any information already about the IRC, get
rid of it (OK, you can glance at it if you really want to...)  Most
IRC clients were designed to function correctly under a Unix 
environment, which can get very confusing.  The client you are using, 
however, was designed to be easy for you to use.  You may read or see 
people talking about some strange commands.  Don't bother with those 
commands.  For example, "/msg" and "/me" are common commands in Unix
versions of IRC, but not necessary here.

The Internet wasn't designed to be confusing, it just ended up that
way.  However, using the Major BBS IRC client, things have been 
simplified a great deal.  If you have used the standard Major BBS
teleconference, you already know the basics of how to use this  
IRC Client.

When you start IRC, you will be asked for a server to use.  Don't 
worry about this.  Unless you have a reason to enter the name of a
specific server, you can just hit RETURN for the default server.  
Next, you will be asked for a nickname.  This can be any name up to 
9 characters long.  It must, however, be unique.  If someone else 
is using the name, you will have to choose a new one.

Once you are connected, you will be transferred to a default
channel.  You can either stay there and talk to whoever is there,
or you can go to another channel.


How long does it take to connect to a server?
=============================================

If the server you are trying to connect to is not very busy, you
should be able to connect very quickly.  However, if you are trying
to connect to a busy server, it may take a while to get through.


How do I get to another channel?
================================

There may be thousands of channels.  To list the channels that are
available, type "LIST" (without the quotes).

To join a channel, type "JOIN channel" (where channel is the name
of the channel you want).  For example, to enter the Worldgroup 
channel, you would type "JOIN Worldgroup".


How do I talk to other people?
==============================

Just type what you want to say, and it will be sent to everyone who
is in the same channel as you.

If you want to say something privately to another user, you can 
either type "WHISPER TO <username> <message>" or "/<username> 
<message>".  For example, to say "hi" to "Gcomm", you could either 
type in "whisper to gcomm hi!" or "/gcomm hi!".

To send another whisper to the same person, you can type 
"// <message>", which sends the message to the last person you
whispered to.


How do I find out who someone is?
=================================

There isn't much information available on IRC about the different
people.  However, you can get what information is available by
typing "WHOIS <username>".  To see some information about the user
"Gcomm", you would type: "WHOIS Gcomm".


How do I do an action?
======================
                                  
If you are familiar with Major BBS and the teleconference, you
know about actions.  An action makes it appear that you are
doing something in a teleconference, rather than just saying it.
For example, instead of seeing "Gcomm: I'm upset", you can see
"Gcomm is upset", which appears a bit more realistic.

To perform an action, just type "ACTION <action>".  With the 
above example (assuming your nickname was Gcomm), you would type
simply "ACTION is upset".


Can I forget a user?
====================

Just type "FORGET <user>"  (or, "/F <user>") to forget someone.  
From then on, you will not see anything by that user.  If they 
try sending a whisper to you, they will receive a notice that 
you have forgotten them.

If the user changes to a new nickname, the IRC client will 
automatically detect this.  Therefore, you won't see what they
say even if they try changing their nickname.

If you decide you want to see what someone says again, just type
"REMEMBER <user>".  

If you want to see a list of who you have forgotten, just type
"FORGET ?".


How do I change my Nickname?
============================

You can change your nickname at any time.  Just type "NICK
<nickname>".  For example, to change your name to Joey, type:
"NICK Joey".


What about DCC?
===============

Some IRC clients have something called DCC.  It lets you send or
receive files, and allows for secure private messages.

Normally, you won't need this.  And, you can't start a DCC chat 
or send a file with DCC.  However, if someone wants to start a
DCC chat or send a file with DCC, it will work.  You will see
instructions on what you need to do.

To send a line of text over a DCC connection (assuming it's 
already been established), just type "/DCC <message>".  For 
example, "/DCC Can you see this?".


What about CTCP?
================

Most IRC clients have special commands, called CTCP commands.  
These let you find out information about the client that a user
is using, and some other general information.

The following CTCP commands can be used with this IRC client:
FINGER, VERSION, SOURCE, USERINFO, CLIENTINFO, PING and TIME.

To enter CTCP commands, first you need to enable CTCP.  To do 
this, just type "CTCP ON" (to turn off CTCP commands, type CTCP
OFF).  Then, you just enter the CTCP command, followed by the
nickname of the person you want to perform the command on.  For
example, to get the FINGER information on Joey, type:

CTCP ON   (unless you've already done this)
FINGER JOEY

Then, within a second or two, you should see the information 
about Joey.  

When a user asks for CTCP information about you, you will see
a message on your screen telling you about it.

Here's what the commands do:

FINGER - Shows basic information about a user (usually their
real name, and how long they have been idle).

VERSION - Shows the version of the IRC client being used.

SOURCE - Shows where to get a copy of the IRC client that the
user is using.

USERINFO - Shows information that the user has set about himself.

CLIENTINFO - Shows what CTCP commands the IRC client knows.

PING - Measures the delay it takes for data to get to the user
and back to you.

TIME - Shows the date and time.


Other Commands
==============

AWAY <message>:  This will mark you as being away, and send the
message you enter to anyone that tries to contact you.

MYINFO <message>:  This sets a message that will be shown when 
users look at your CTCP USERINFO information.

INVITE <user>:  This will invite a user to your channel, if you
are the operator.

UNINVITE <user>:  This will cancel the invitation that you gave to
a user.

TOPIC <topic>:  This will set the topic for a channel, if you are
an operator for the channel.

MODE <modes>:  If you are the operator of a channel, this will set
the modes for the channel.  


    The MailLink(tm) Messaging Service
    ----------------------------------

    Our system is conencted to many other Major BBS systems via the
    MajorNet(tm), a large network for private and public messages.


    MAJORNET AND MAILLINK GUIDELINES FOR USERS

     PART A: PRIVATE MAIL
       
       1. Sending

          Every system on the MajorNet has its own three-letter alphanumeric
          "Node-Id".  Users on these other systems have "User-Id"s just like
          yours.  To send a letter to a user on one of these other systems,
          you would go into the EMAIL section, just as if you were going to
          send a letter to someone on your system.  When the system asks
          you who you want to send the letter to, you put in the User-Id
          of the user on that other system, followed by an "@" (at symbol),
          and then the Node-Id of the system they are on.  Examples:
          "John@BNZ", "Joe Smith@PRO",  "Groaci@CDT".

          You may not attach a file to another user over the MajorNet.

          You are asked if you want to request a return receipt.  Return
          receipts work a bit differently over the MajorNet.  If you
          request a return receipt, a letter will be generated to you
          as soon as the recipient system receives the letter, not when
          the target user reads the letter.  If the user you addressed the
          letter to does not exist, the letter you get back will tell you
          this - but you only get this letter if you asked for a return
          receipt.  If the Node-Id your letter was addressed to does not
          exist, you will get a letter informing you of this fact, whether
          or not you requested a return receipt.

          MailLink for the version 6 of the Major BBS allows you to copy
          and forward messages to MajorNet addresses, or to local users
          and Forums.  MailLink for the version 5 of the Major BBS does not.

       2. Receiving

          You can always tell if you get a letter over the MajorNet when you
          are online, because you are paged with a notification.  The letter
          is stored in your E-MAIL box so you can read it as any other
          letter.  What the header of the letter looks like, depends on your
          version of the Major BBS.

          VERSION 5 HEADER:

          E-Mail #9460 02-NOV-92 15:55 (ML@UPD Sysop)
          From: -MHS-
            To: You
            Re: This is a V5 MBBS header


          VERSION 6 HEADER:

          Date: Monday, November 2, 1992  3:55pm               Electronic Mail
          From: -MHS-                                               Msg#: 9460
            To: You
            Re: This is a V6 MBBS header
           MHS: ML@UPD {MBBS: Sysop}

          These headers have much the same elements, and using this as a
          reference you can tell who sent the message.    In these cases,
          the messages were sent to you by "ML@UPD Sysop" or "ML@UPD {MBBS:
          Sysop} which is just a fancy way of saying "Sysop@UPD".  If you
          wanted to (R)eply, you can do so by selecting (R) right after
          reading the message, just as with any other EMAIL letter.
          
          To find out where and when this message was sent, you have to read
          the message, and near the end of the message there is a "tagline":

          ---
          Sent via MailLink on 02-NOV-92, at 09:47:08 (Pacific Time) from:
          (UPD)MajorNet Central Hub - (206) 351 0561
          Auburn, Washington

          From this, you can get the approximate date and time the message was
          posted to you by the sending user (the time is recorded as the
          origin system knew it, when this message was picked up by the
          importer program, so it is not necessarily the exact time).  Also
          here is the name and phone number of the originating system, and its
          geographical location.

       3. Privacy

          The MajorNet is not designed for secure communications.  Do not
          discuss anything in private messages which you do not mind a
          SYSOP stumbling over when he runs a diagnostic on the hard drive
          and finds your message wasn't erased properly.   There is very
          little difference from posting a private message on your local
          system.

                             
     PART B: PUBLIC MESSAGES: MAJORNET NEWSGROUPS IN FORUMS ON YOUR SYSTEM


       1. Which forums?

          In order to tell which Forums (SIGs = Forums) on your system
          are "attached" to MajorNet newsgroups, you may go into the
          MailLink menu which your system operator has probably set up,
          and there is an option which lists them.


       2. Differences in the way the software works

          The message headers in the Forums for messages which have come to
          your system via the MajorNet are similar to the headers in PART B
          of EMAIL messages.

          One important difference, is that the USER who originally sent the
          message is not listed anywhere in the header.  The USER who sent
          the message, has his User-ID in a second TAGLINE, above the first
          one, near the end of the message.  Example:

          -----------------------------------
          Origin: MBBS@UPD {MBBS: Freddy}

          ---
          Sent via MailLink on 02-NOV-92, at 09:47:08 (Pacific Time) from:
          (UPD)MajorNet Central Hub - (206) 351 0561
          Auburn, Washington


          The User-Id of the user who sent the message bearing these TAGLINES
          is "Freddy", and you can send him a private message to him by going
          to EMAIL and writing a letter to Freddy@UPD.  (R)eplying to this
          message will allow you to post a message in the newsgroup in
          response to the one you just read - but keep in mind, it is very
          difficult for other users to tell exactly which message you were
          replying to, so be specific.  Don't post a "one-liner" response,
          because nobody will know what you were talking about, or who you
          were responding to.
          
          (E)mail replying to this message does NOT send email over the
          MajorNet to the user who sent the original message.  (E)mail
          replying to a MajorNet message sends a PUBLIC MESSAGE via the
          MajorNet, to the Forum on the system where the message you
          responded to was ORIGINALLY posted.  There, anyone can read it -
          although it does not go out as a "newsgroup" message.  This
          (E)mail reply feature is not avaiable on MailLink for the version 5
          Major BBS.


       3. Conduct

          Things which are NOT ALLOWED on the MajorNet:

          Inflammatory or harrassing public messages, harrassing volumes of
               messages, and personal attacks/FLAMES.

          Harrassment via private MajorNet message.

          Profanity in areas where profanity is not explicitly allowed.

          Messages promoting Ponzi schemes/"get rich quick" pyramid messages.

          Any and all illegal activity and promotion of illegal activities
               as defined by the laws of your specific state and the federal
               government are not allowed, such as "growing marijuana for
               sale".

          COMMON SENSE AND GOOD TASTE RULES - Thousands of people will judge
               YOU by what you POST.  Remember this BEFORE you write a single
               message.

          TOPIC SENSITIVITY - Please post messages which have some relation-
               ship to the PURPOSE of the newsgroup!

          COMPLAINTS - Send ANY and ALL complaints about someone to YOUR
               System Operator.  Do NOT clutter a newsgroup with whiny
               complaints about someone.

          RULE INFRACTIONS - If found guily by the local Sysop, punishment
               is set by the local Sysop based on severity of the offense
               and could range from the reuirement of a public apology, to
               to permanent removal of the user's access to the MajorNet.



    Hangman's Secret Cove
    ---------------------

    Hangman's Secret Cove is a take-off of the ol' time favorite word game
    of hangman, but with a twist of casino-type gambling!

    You make a bet, and then the computer randomly chooses a word/phrase
    from its large database.  You then may guess one letter at a time in an
    attempt to figure out the word/phrase.  You may only guess each letter
    in the alphabet once (all occurences of the letter will be shown with
    the first guess).  After 6 wrong guesses, you lose your bet.  At any
    time, you may also take a guess at the entire word/phrase, however if
    you guess incorrectly, you'll lose automatically.  There are only
    letters (no numbers, hypens, or special characters) in each
    word/phrase.  You may exit in the middle of a game by typing "*", but
    you will lose half of your wager.  There is a minimum wager of 10
    chips, and a maximum of 1000 chips.

    Each time you log into the system, if you have less than 100 chips, you
    are given 100 chips to play with.


    The Messaging System
    --------------------

    Messages are used in both the Forums and the Electronic Mail areas.

     Electronic Mail:    private messages from one user to another

     Forums:             public messages from many users, readable by many

    There's a lot of overlap between the Electronic Mail and Forums.  For
    example, when you write an electronic mail message, you can send it to
    one user, and send a carbon copy to a Forum.  Or you can reply
    privately to the author of a Forum message, and other users won't see
    that reply.  And usually the best way to erase a message you wrote in a
    Forum is to use the E-mail read command to find it and then erase it.

    Electronic messages consist of:

     o   Header
     o   Body
     o   File attached (optional)

    The header contains information like who the message is to, who it's
    from, what the topic is, and when it was written.


    Message Topic:

    Each time you write a new message, you need to give it a topic.  When
    you reply to a message, you inherit the topic of the original message.


    Message Body:

    You can compose the body of a message you're writing using the editor.
    You'll get the full screen editor if you have an ANSI-compatible
    terminal.  Otherwise you'll use a line-oriented editor.

    Reading a message displays the message body on your terminal.  Whenever
    you read a message's body, the BBS makes a note not to include that
    message again when you scan for new messages.


    Message Number:

    The BBS issues a new sequential message number each time anyone writes
    a new message.  Whether it's a private electronic mail message to one
    user, or a message in some Forum, it has a unique message number on the
    BBS.  This message number is used to jump directly to a message you
    want to read or reply to.


    Files Attached to Messages:

    When you write an Electronic Mail or Forum message, you usually have
    the option of attaching a file to the message.  You upload the file
    after you write the message.  Then, anyone who reads the message gets
    the option of downloading the file.


    File Names:

    When you attach a file to a message, put the name of the file in the
    topic of the message.  You can put the description of the file after
    that.  For example:

     Topic:  FONTCVT.EXE - converts printer fonts

    This file name will be used when a user downloads with a multi-file
    protocol like YMODEM Batch or ZMODEM.  That is, the file's name on the
    user's machine will be FONTCVT.EXE.  File transfers will be discussed
    more depth later...


    Modifying or Erasing a Message You Wrote:

    First, find the message.  Whether its a Forum message or an Electronic
    Mail message, you can find it from the Electronic Mail menu.  You can
    (R)ead all messages (F)rom you, and scan through them until you find
    the one you want to change.  After reading your message you'll get the
    chance to modify it by selecting the M option.  To just erase a
    message, find it, read it, and select E to (E)rase.

    On the other hand, if you know the number of the message you want to
    modify or erase, there's another way.  Just use the (M)odify or (E)rase
    option from the Electronic Mail menu.  It will work on Forum messages
    you wrote as well as on Electronic Mail messages.


    Electronic Mail
    ---------------

    Electronic Mail allows you to send private messages to other users of
    the BBS.  Electronic Mail has several advantages over other modes of
    communication:

     o   You can dial into the BBS from almost anywhere, at almost any
         time, write your message, and forget about it -- no stamp, no
         paper to carry around.

     o   The recipient of your message has a copy he can capture and
         print out if he wants.  Or he can leave the message in his
         "in-box" and get it out later.

     o   You can attach a disk file to your message.  No need to mail
         floppy diskettes, or to bring up two computers with file
         transfer software at the same time.  You upload when you want,
         your recipient downloads when he wants.

     o   You can request a return-receipt, so you know when the person
         read your message.

     o   Your recipient can easily reply to your message, sending
         another message back to you.  Your original message will
         usually be available to you again so you can "backtrack"
         and remember what the user was replying to.

     o   You can easily copy your message to other users.

     o   You can send your message to distribution lists.

     o   You can create one distribution list of your own.


    Electronic Mail Messages

    Here's what an electronic mail message header looks like:

     Date: Thursday, April 23, 1992  12:37pm           Electronic Mail
     From: Arthur Fischel                                  Msg#: 20483
       To: Richard T. Natheson              *RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED*
     File: BOOTH.DWG - for trade show in Phoenix
           (Reply to #20461, Reply to #20409)

    The *RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED* flag indicates that the sender wants to
    be notified when you read this message.  When you do, a message is
    automatically generated by the BBS from you back to the author of the
    message, informing him that you read his message and when.


    Files Attached to Electronic Mail Messages

    To send a file to another user, you can write him an electronic mail
    message and upload an attached file.  When he reads the message, he has
    the option of downloading the file.


    R=Read messages

    The Major BBS keeps track of the messages that were written to you and
    the messages that you have written.

     In-box    messages TO you      messages others wrote to you

     Out-box   messages FROM you    messages you wrote to someone else

    Either of these sets can be scanned, one message at a time, with the
    E-mail read command.  These include private messages between you and
    other users as well as public messages in the Forums.  (Whether your
    in-box includes Forum messages or not is your option:  see below, under
    setting preferences.)


    R=Read messages T=To you

    You'll have these options for where to start your reading:

     RETURN or dot (.)  Start with the next message you haven't read yet
     F                  Start with the earliest message in your in-box
     L                  Start with the very latest message in your in-box
     <message number>   Start with a specific message number


    The Default or Next Message

    You'll probably be calling into the BBS regularly to get your latest
    messages.  Some of your messages are not urgent, or they require more
    work to reply to, or you just want to keep them around for a while.

    The Major BBS tries to distinguish between new messages and messages
    you've already read by remembering the highest numbered message you've
    ever read from your in-box.  This isn't perfect, but if you're careful
    to read your messages in order, you might find it very handy for
    keeping your urgent mail and your not-so-important mail separated.

    When you (R)ead messages (T)o you and hit RETURN when it asks for a
    message number, you'll get the message that's one higher than the
    highest numbered message that you've already read.  You can do the same
    thing in one step by typing "RT." from the E-mail menu.

    As an example, imagine you have an in-box tray on your desk.  New mail
    is always getting added to the top of your pile.  You often peek at
    your mail starting from the bottom.  After you read a piece of mail
    that you want to keep for the moment, you slip a piece of red paper
    over it.  When you read another piece, you slip the red paper over it.
    Now you have new mail on top, red paper, old mail.  To quickly see if
    you have new mail, see what's on top of the red paper.

    Here's what some other E-mail commands are like (these are the
    concatenated command sequences -- you can enter one letter at a time to
    have all the prompts displayed):

     E-mail    for
     command   reading        Analogous to
     -------   -------        ------------
     RTF       Old mail       scanning from the bottom of your mail up
     RT.       New mail       scanning from your first new message up
     RTL       Latest mail    scanning from the last message in your box

    Sometimes, you read a message and just can't handle the message right
    away, but you don't want to forget about it.  There is a way to make a
    message you have already read new again:  forward it to yourself.
    Then, next time you log on, it will appear as new mail again, and you
    can deal with it then.

    So, in Electronic Mail, the default or next message is the message
    right after the highest numbered message that you've already read.  You
    actually need to read the message (see the body of it) for it to be
    counted as "old" mail.


    R=Read messages F=From you

    Messages "from" you include all the E-mail and Forum messages you've
    written that are still on the system.

    After finding and reading a message you've written, you may get these
    options:

     (E)rase this message, (M)odify it, (P)revious or (N)ext message?


    Read Commands

     RTF  Read all your incoming mail, starting with the earliest message
     RT.  Read your incoming mail, starting with "new" mail
     RTL  Read your latest piece of incoming mail
     RFF  Read the earliest piece of outgoing mail
     RFL  Read your latest piece of outgoing mail


    (R)eply to the message

    When you reply, you are writing a new message back to the author of the
    original message.

    If your E-mail preferences have been set to allow message quoting, you
    can use pieces of the original message in your reply, and address each
    point directly (more on personal preferences below).


    Replying without Erasing

    You can set your E-mail preferences to automatically erase when you
    reply to an E-mail message, or to leave the original message in your
    in-box.  But even if you're set up to automatically erase, there is a
    way to get around it, and save the original message.

    Say you're typing in a reply to a message, and you decide you don't
    want to lose the original message.  Maybe you want to keep it on file,
    or you want to send a copy to someone.  The way to skip the automatic
    deleting of the original message is to hit X to exit before the
    deleting takes place.  The place to do this is the carbon copy
    question.  When you're asked about carbon copies, your message has
    already been saved and stored, and the original has not yet been
    deleted.  It would get deleted if you answered N to the carbon copy
    question.  Instead:

     Do you want to send a copy of this message to anyone (Y/N)? X

    (Don't exit from the attach-file or return-receipt question -- you'll
    lose your reply entirely.)


    (E)rase the message

    After reading an E-mail message to you, pick this option to just get
    rid of the message.


    (C)lear message

    After reading a Forum message, pick this option to remove it from your
    in-box.  You won't delete the message this way -- it will still reside
    in the Forum, but will not show up in your in-box any more.


    (F)orward the message

    Forwarding the message is like handing a piece of mail to someone else.
    They get the message and it disappears from your "in-box".


    Reply after Forward

    In some cases, you may want to both reply to a message and forward it
    to someone else.  The dilemma is that either of these operations by
    itself usually leaves you with no message.  You can both send the
    original message to a third person, and send a reply to the original
    author by invoking the reply after forward option.  To use this, you
    need to enter "F <User-ID> R" all on one line.

    You could also send a carbon copy of the reply to the third person
    after you're done writing the reply.


    (C)opy the message

    Copying the message sends a copy of it to another user.  You keep the
    original message in your in-box.


    (B)acktrack to the original message

    After viewing a reply to one of your messages, you can view the
    original message using the (B)acktrack option.  This is very helpful
    when you can remember asking someone a question, you now have their
    answer, but you can't remember the question.  Backtrack brings it up if
    it's still on the system.  Even if the other user deleted your message
    from his in-box, your message still remains sort of hidden in your
    out-box, just for this purpose.


    (P)revious or (N)ext message

    Skip chronologically through the messages in your in-box or out-box
    with the (P)revious or (N)ext commands.  Any time you're viewing a
    message header or body, or you've just downloaded an attachment, you
    can usually move around to other messages with (P)revious and (N)ext.


    W=Write a message

    You can write an electronic mail message to:

     <User-ID>    a specific user
     RETURN       to the Sysop
     /<forum>     to a Forum
     @<list>      to a distribution list
     !quick       to your own custom distribution list
     !mass        to all users (special access may be required)

    When writing to an individual user, if you can't remember their User-ID
    exactly, just type in an approximation and the BBS will try to find a
    match.  When writing to a Forum from E-mail, you are writing to ALL
    users in the Forum (more on the Forums later).


    Attach a file?

    After you write a message, you get the option of uploading a file and
    attaching it to the message (assuming you have access).

     Do you wish to "attach" a file to this message (Y/N)?

    Be careful to complete this step or your message will get lost.  For
    example, if you type X to exit instead of yes or no, you'll loose the
    message you just wrote.


    Return Receipt?

    The next option after deciding on the attached-file issue is whether
    you want to be notified when the recipient reads your message.

     Do you want a "return receipt" when this message is read (Y/N)?

    A return receipt is a brief message that The Major BBS automatically
    generates from the reader when he first reads the message.

    After answering the return-receipt question, the message is actually
    saved and stored.

     <<< CONFIRMED: MESSAGE #78933 WRITTEN TO DISK >>>

    It's important that you at least get to this point in writing a
    message.  If you don't, and you X=exit back to the E-mail menu, or lose
    carrier, your message will be lost.

    If the person you're writing to is also online when you get to this
    point, he may get a BEEP and a message on his terminal like:

     ***
     Irving R. Neely has just written an E-mail message to you!
     (You can find it by invoking (E)mail (R)ead-msgs (T)o you.)


    Carbon Copies?

    You can send copies of the message you've written to other users.

     Do you want to send a copy of this message to anyone (Y/N)? Y

     Who do you wish to send a copy of this message (cc:) to?
     You may also type "?" for help: ED CHAVEZ

     <<< CONFIRMED: MESSAGE #79833      COPIED TO #79834      >>>
     <<<               SENT TO Ed Chavez                      >>>

     Do you want to send a copy of this message to anyone else (Y/N)? N

    By the way, you may be able to save time by answering all three
    questions at once (using concatenated commands):

     Do you wish to "attach" a file to this message (Y/N)? NNN

    This means the message has no attached file, no return receipt
    requested, and no copies to anyone.


    M=Modify or E=Erase a message

    You need to know the message number before you can use either of these
    options.  You can find the message number of a message you wrote by
    (R)eading mail (F)rom you and scanning (N)ext or (P)revious until you
    find the one you're looking for.


    S=Special functions

    This is a little menu for managing various features of your Electronic
    Mail "mailbox".

     Choose a special function:

        C => Configure distribution list
        A => Auto-forward incoming E-mail
        S => Set personal preferences

     Your choice (or X to exit)?


    S=Special functions, C=Configure distribution list

    Your distribution list can have up to 40 entries.  When you write a
    message to !QUICK, the BBS will send it to all of the names you have
    put in your list.

    There's no checking for correct User-ID's.  You can even specify users
    who haven't signed up yet.  But be sure and get their User-ID exactly
    right (except it doesn't matter whether you use upper or lower case).


    S=Special functions, A=Auto-forward incoming E-mail

    You can set things up so that all mail written to your User-ID will be
    automatically forwarded to another User-ID.  This is helpful if you're
    going to be out of town for a while and someone is keeping on top of
    your messages.  Or, if you want to change your User-ID, you can forward
    messages from the old User-ID until everyone gets used to using the new
    User-ID.

    This forwarding is not apparent to whoever is writing the message.

    Forum messages to you are not affected by auto-forwarding.  They'll
    still appear in your original in-box (if you have your preferences set
    to include Forum messages in your in-box -- see below).  Also, enabling
    auto-forward only affects future messages -- any E-mail currently in
    your in-box remains there.  For example:

     User-ID to auto-forward E-mail to (X to exit): SAM JONES


    S=Special functions, S=Set personal preferences

    You can personalize your mailbox with these options:

     1.  Should replying to E-mail messages erase them?  (default is YES)

         NO:  the messages will remain in my in-box.

         YES:  replying to an E-mail message automatically erases
               it, and replying to a Forum message automatically clears
               it from my in-box.

     2.  How to handle new messages when you log on?  (default is 3)

         1.  Read them immediately.
         2.  Ask me if I want to read them immediately.
         3.  Just notify me that I have new mail waiting.

     3.  Should Forum messages that are directed to you appear in
         your E-mail in box?  (default is YES)

         When you read your E-mail, you may also want to be notified of
         any new messages directed to you in the Forums.

         YES:  mix these in with my private E-mail.

         NO:  don't bother me about them.  I'll just have to see them in
              the Forums or not at all.

     4.  When will you want to quote exerpts of a message when replying
         to it?  (default is 3)

         1.  Sometimes (ask me each time I reply to a message)
         2.  Always
         3.  Never

         Replying to a message with quoting is something like taking a
         business letter and scribbling your comments in the margins and
         mailing it back to the sender, only neater.

         When you reply with quoting, you start out, not with a blank
         message, but with the contents of the original message filling
         up your screen.  You can delete and insert as appropriate to
         address each part of the original message specifically.  This is
         very helpful to the original author, especially when he writes
         you very large messages.


    The Forums
    ----------

    Forums are for gathering people and information.

    Bulletin Boards have many features that compare in interesting ways
    with things we're all used to.  A post office delivers mail to your
    door -- bulletin boards do it electronically.  A newspaper conveys a
    large amount of very timely information -- bulletin boards can convey
    more information faster, but not to as many people (yet).  A phone book
    can help you contact anyone in a city -- a bulletin board could offer
    more versatile access to more timely information (it's already being
    done in France).

    But there's nothing quite like a BBS Forum.

    In a forum, lots of people write messages and lots of people read or
    search or scan messages.  You can direct a message to all users, or to
    a specific user.  You can search for messages in many ways:
    chronologically, by topic, by conversation "threads", by message
    content, by lists of keywords, or by the unique message number.  You
    can also search in the same ways for messages with files attached.
    There are other features we'll get to later.

    Here's an example Forum menu:

     Your current Forum is /Hello: Welcome to the BBS!

        R => Read messages
        W => Write a message
        Q => Quickscan Menu
        F => Filescan
        T => Teleconference
        S => Select a new Forum
        X => Exit from Forums

     Select a letter from this list, or ? for more info:

    When you first log on, you'll probably be in a welcoming or
    introductory Forum like this "/Hello" Forum.


    S?=See a list of Forums

    Before you do anything else in the Forums, you'll probably want to see
    what Forums are online.  Entering S? will display to you a list of
    Forums available to you.


    S=Select another Forum

    Use S to select another Forum.  Once in another Forum, you get the same
    menu, with the new Forum name and description at the top.


    Messages in a Forum

    Here's what a message header looks like in a Forum:

     Date: Monday, April 27, 1992  11:23am                   /IntSales
     From: Stuart Blaumberg                               Msg#: 108782
       To: Cristina Rodolfo
       Re: Singapore sales office (impressive growth!)     (7 replies)
           (Reply to #108623, Fw by Tom Gerhart)


    Who a message is To

    You can write a message in a Forum to a specific user, or to ** ALL **
    users.  Either way, the message is visible to anyone who has the proper
    access to the Forum.  Writing a message to a specific user gets his
    attention when he reads his mail (assuming his preference settings
    include Forum messages in his in-box).

    When writing to an individual user, if you can't remember their User-ID
    exactly, just type in an approximation and the BBS will try to find a
    match.

    All replies in a Forum are automatically directed to the writer of the
    message you're replying to.  Keep this in mind when adding your own
    message to a thread:  Which message would be best to reply to?  Which
    user are you really speaking to, or who do you want to see your message
    most?


    Files in a Forum

    The Forums emphasize messages.  Files in a Forum are always attached to
    messages.

    You can think of the way files are kept in a Forum in two ways:

     A message with a file attached
     A file with a detailed description

    Either way it's the same thing.  A message can incidentally have a file
    attached to it.  Or the message can be a description or introduction to
    the file.

    By convention, the topic of a message with a file attached contains the
    file name and a brief description of the file.  Nothing requires this,
    although whenever anyone uploads a file they are encouraged to put a
    file name in the topic field.

    If you have an ASCII file that you want to contribute to a Forum, the
    easiest thing to do is write a message and upload the file as an
    attachment.  (You can use any upload protocol, not just the ASCII
    protocol.)  The message could be empty, or explain something like
    "here's the file that ...".  Other users can use the ASCII or LIST
    download protocols to see the contents on their terminals.

    When you write a message to a Forum, you have the option of uploading a
    file and attaching it to the message.  When you read a message that has
    a file attached, you get a chance to download the file.


    Threading

    A thread is a bunch of messages on the same topic.  You'll probably
    find many different threads going on at the same time in a Forum.  Say
    you write a message and somebody else writes a reply to it.  You reply
    to that, someone else replies to it too, and then someone else replies
    to your original message.  Before you know it, a tree of messages is
    formed.  All of these messages usually keep the same topic.  We call
    this a thread.

    When you're scanning messages, you may come across a message with a lot
    of replies, or one that's a reply itself.  You can digress from your
    scan to see what else has taken place on this thread before you
    contribute yourself.

    Threading forward and backward is chronological.  So in a complex
    thread you won't always see a message next to its reply.  You may see
    the messages of one little sub-conversation alternating with those of
    another.

    If message number 123 is a reply, threading to its parent lets you see
    the message that 123 was a reply to.  You can keep threading up to the
    original message that started it all, if it's still online.


    Changing the Topic of a Reply

    You can change the topic of a reply, but by doing this you'll lose the
    "thread" of the conversation.  Then other users won't be able to find
    your message when they're threading through the other messages on the
    original topic.

    If you reply to a message and change the topic, the Thread Forward and
    Thread Backward commands won't find your message, but the Thread Parent
    command will.  You may want to do this to break off from the original
    conversation and start another one.


    Forum Header

    This is the very first message in a Forum.  You can see the Forum
    header by typing "RS0" from the Forum menu.  The header may contain
    lots of information on the Forum, including how long messages are kept,
    and the charges for using the Forum (if any).

    Here's an example of a Forum header:

     #1  FORUM HEADER: /Hello           Created 03-FEB-92 11:09
     Forum-Op: Sysop
     Forum Topic: Welcome to the BBS!

     This is the /Hello Forum Header.

     Sysop

    #1 is the message number in this case.  The Forum operator is the Sysop
    himself.  The topic of the Forum appears at the Forum menu.


    R=Read messages

    There are many ways for you to read messages in a Forum.  Actually,
    most of the features you'll find here are not for reading messages.
    They're for finding the messages you're interested in.  Once you've
    read the message, there are many options for what to do with it, and
    what message to read next.


    R=Read, S=Scan through messages, one at a time

    During a scan, you get to look at message headers one at a time in
    chronological order (the order they were written in).  You get the
    option to read the messages, download attached files, reply publicly,
    or reply privately.

    You'll have these options for where to start your scanning:

     RETURN or dot (.)   Start with the next message you haven't read yet

     F                   Start with the first message in the Forum
                         (the Forum header)

     L                   Start with the very latest message in the Forum

     <message number>    Start with a specific message number


    The Default or Next Message

    You'll probably be calling into the BBS regularly to see "what's new"
    in the Forums.  The Major BBS tries to keep track of where you left off
    when you last read messages in a Forum.  But it doesn't keep track of
    exactly which messages you've read.  It just remembers the highest
    numbered message.  When you come back, you pick up after that one.
    This is the default or next message that you get by just hitting RETURN
    when asked for a starting message number.

    So, in a Forum, the default or next message is the message right after
    the highest numbered message that you've already read.

    You need to read the message (see the body of it) for this to count.
    Except that reading while threading forward or backward doesn't count.


    R=Read, L=List messages out, nonstop

    If you want messages to just scroll by on your screen without stopping
    to reply or download any files, then listing could be handy.  You could
    also capture all messages and read them offline this way.  Later you
    could call back to download specific files or reply to specific
    messages.

    There are three types of listings depending on how much you want to
    see:

     o   Brief one-liner descriptions of the message

     o   Titles, or message headers, 4-6 lines long

     o   Full messages, with header and body

    In all of these cases you can specify the starting point like you do in
    a scan and the listing goes from there forward, to the end of the
    Forum.

     RETURN or (.)         Next or default message
     F                     First message
     L                     Last message
     <message number>      Any specific message in the Forum


    R=Read, K=Keyword search

    Keyword searching is just like scanning except that you'll only see
    messages that contain some special words or phrases you're looking for.

     Keyword            Example matches
     -------            ---------------
     demo               Demonstration   pandemonium   demolition
     -demo-             demo  "DEMO"
     red day            By Monday, I was tired of waiting
     red-letter-day     Thursday was a red letter day

    As you can see, a hyphen has a special purpose in keywords:

     A word with hyphens around it will specify an exact match on the
     entire word.

     A hyphen will match a space, a line boundary, any punctuation
     symbol, or any combination of these.


    Read Commands

    You can answer several questions at once by typing them all on the same
    line.  All of these read commands work from the Forum menu:

     RSF       Scan from the first message
     RS.       Scan starting from the next new message
     RS38501   Scan from message number 38501
     RSL       Scan from the last message
     RLBF      List brief titles of all messages
     RLTF      List 4-line titles of all messages
     RLFF      List all messages fully
     RLB.      List brief titles starting with the new messages
     RLT.      List 4-line titles starting with the new messages
     RLF.      List full messages starting with the new messages


    After Reading a Message

    After you read a message in a Forum, you'll get a prompt like this:

     (R)eply, (E)mail reply, follow (T)hread, (P)revious or (N)ext message?


    (R)eply in this Forum

    If you reply, the author of the original message will see your reply in
    his electronic mail, assuming his E-mail preferences are set
    accordingly.  Other users who read this Forum will also see your reply
    as part of a thread.


    (E)mail (private) reply

    You can reply privately to the author of a message in a Forum using the
    (E)mail reply option.  The author will see your message in his
    electronic mail.  No other user will be able to see it.


    Follow (T)hread

    A thread is a bunch of messages on the same topic.  The messages are
    formed into a tree by replying and re-replying.  You can move through
    the thread in these ways:

     Thread (F)orward, (B)ackward, or to (P)arent (? for help):

    The thread options can be combined into character pairs:  Rather than
    typing T RETURN P RETURN, you can type TP RETURN (using concatenated
    commands).

     TB  (T)hread (B)ackward       skip back to earlier messages
                                   on the same topic, in
                                   chronological order

     TF  (T)hread (F)orward        skip forward to newer messages
                                   on the same topic, in
                                   chronological order

     TP  (T)hread to (P)arent      jump back to the "parent"
                                   of this message -- the one
                                   it was a reply to

    You can continue to type TF RETURN TF RETURN to move through the
    thread, etc.

    All this threading is a digression:  you'll resume your original scan
    from where you left off when you choose the (N)ext or (P)revious
    message.


    (P)revious or (N)ext message

    Skip chronologically through the messages in the Forum.  You'll often
    use P RETURN P RETURN P RETURN ... to zoom backward in time, or N
    RETURN N RETURN N RETURN ... to zoom forward.  You can also type NNNN
    RETURN to leap over four messages at once -- seeing all their headers
    as you do.


    F=Filescan -- look only for messages with files attached

    The Filescan option from the Forum menu operates exactly like the read
    option with one important difference:  only messages with files
    attached are scanned.  Everything else in the above description of
    reading messages also applies to file scanning.


    Q=Quickscan multiple Forums

    Here's another powerful variation on reading messages.  You can specify
    your own preferences for some of the Forums, and even the kind of
    information you'd like to see in those Forums.

    That way you're saved the trouble of switching to several different
    Forums each time you log on, or of wading through reams of messages
    that you're not interested in.


    Configuring Your Quickscan

    The first step is to configure your quickscan by answering these
    questions:

     o   Which Forums are you interested in?
     o   Do you want to narrow the scan down to messages with certain
         keywords?

    Here's an example of some keywords and possible matches:

     Keyword             Example of a match
     -------             ------------------
     1. COMP COMMUNIC    computer communications, company must communicate
     2. MODEM COMMUNIC   modem communicating
     3. PACKET SWITCH    packet switching networks, packet of switches


    Keyword Phrases

    The search will look for messages that match any of the above 3 keyword
    phrases, but the match must be complete on all of the words in a
    keyword phrase.

    In more technical terms, the search is looking for a message with:

     COMP and COMMUNIC
     or
     MODEM and COMMUNIC
     or
     PACKET and SWITCH


    Which Forums

    When deciding which Forums to include in your Quickscan, here are some
    things you might type:

     V                   View the Forums now included in your quickscan
     -<forum name>       Remove a Forum from quickscan
     +<forum name>       Add a Forum to quickscan
     -<forum> +<forum>   Reset scanning in a Forum to the beginning
     -ALL                Remove all Forums from your quickscan
     +ALL                Add all Forums to your quickscan

    All new Forums will automatically get added to your quickscan.  If you
    aren't interested in them, you can remove them any time.


    Starting your Quickscan Pointers From Scratch

    If you want your quickscan to review a Forum from the beginning, you
    need to reset your pointers for that Forum, because quickscan tries to
    give you only "new" messages.  To do this, just remove and then add the
    Forum:

     Enter K, V, + or -, or ? for more info: -/ANTON +/ANTON

    Now your next quickscan will start the "/Anton" Forum from the first
    message.  This might be particularly handy if you've changed your
    quickscan keywords, and want to review what you might have missed.


    W=Write a message

    In a Forum, you can write your message to ** ALL ** users, or to a
    specific user.  When you write to a specific user, the message may
    appear in his electronic mail "in-box".

    After making the choice of who your message is to, you can begin
    writing your message.  If your terminal has ANSI capability, you enter
    the full screen editor.  You can type your message a line at a time,
    move the cursor around with the arrow keys, delete lines with CTRL-Y,
    and so on.  CTRL-S saves your message and exits the full screen editor.

    If your terminal doesn't have ANSI capability, you enter the Line
    Editor.  Just type one line at a time here.  The editor will
    automatically wrap lines as you run into the right margin.  When done,
    type "OK" on a single line to save your message and possibly edit it a
    little more.


    After writing a message to a Forum

    After you write a message, you get the option of uploading a file and
    attaching it to the message (assuming you have access).

     Do you wish to "attach" a file to this message (Y/N)?

    Be careful to complete this step or your message will get lost.  For
    example, if you type 'X' to exit instead of yes or no, you'll lose the
    message.


    T=Teleconference

    Every Forum has its own teleconference channel.  The topic of the
    channel is the topic of the Forum (from the Forum header).  See more on
    the teleconference in the "Teleconferencing" section.
